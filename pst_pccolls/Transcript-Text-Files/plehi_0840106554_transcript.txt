S. Senators and Congressmen to resign their seats at the Federal Capitol. it has given rise to a great amount of talk and trouble. U. S.

10  21 Sunday. day pleasant. To day our Company were enrolled into the 4th Regiment of Penna. Volunteers. the letter was given to our Company. G. is our name. I went down to the Capital and had an interview with the Gov. A. G. Curtin and Col. E. Slifer, at 4 P.M. I was appointed Assistant Surgeon of the 4th Reg. of Penna Vol. My Commission was made out immediately and I was ordered to leave with the Reg. which started at 5 P.M. we went in cars to Phila. there we remained untill Monday Morning. this day will be long remembered by me, it being my birth day. Camp Curtin was all alive all day. Sunday was not observed.  22 Day warm. this morning we left Phila. passed through Delaware, and into Maryland where we stopped at Perryville opposite Havre-de-Grace. here we stationed our men along the line clear up to Wilmington Dale in order to protect the Rail Road and the Depot. we also had a good many men on the sick list so we established a Hospital at this point. we were kept busy with the sick all the time here. at night there was a man shot by the name of Rapevine by a sentinel. he would not give the pass word, and therefore he met his death. he was sent to Norristown, his home.  23. Very warm. to day we prescribed for at least 50 patients. Some seriously ill. we got along with them right well.  24 Still warm. Hospital well crowded with patients. to day we were called upon to make an examination of another Norristown man who committed suicide by cutting his throat, he had wandered some three miles from camp. cause unknown. to day nearly all our Regiment left on Steamer Phila. for Annapolis, where we arrived after some 8 hours ride, distance 80 miles.  25 Warm and pleasant. we are now encamped at Annapolis and there are some 6000 soldiers here from R.I. Mass. N.Y. and Penna. the excitment here is very great indeed. this is a beautiful place and where the Naval Academy is located.
11  26 Day very warm. Vegetation is very far advanced at this place. the grass is quite high and trees of all kinds are in blossom. this is a most lovely spot where the Naval School is located. the grounds contain about 50 acres and are fenced in with a high brick wall. Situated on the Banks of the River Severn, about 40 miles from Washington City and 30 from Baltimore. Annapolis itself has some very ancient and dilapidated buildings in it. the place is very old. contains about 4500 inhabitants and is very irregularly laid out. it is the Capital of Md. One week ago the people were nearly all Secessionists, but after the first Regiment of Volunteers arrived many of then turned and are now strong for the Union. there are now about 10,000 Soldiers at this point, getting ready to march to the Capital. One of our men Henry Browne attempted to cut his throat to day, but did not succeed. he had an attack of insanity. I have him now in charge.  27 Still very warm and sultry. the parade ground is still full of military. We have now established a Military Hospital at this point and have quite  a number of patients. none however seriously ill. the New York Regiment furnish us with a great many cases of Mania Potu.   We are still waiting here for the balance of our Regiment.  28 Sunday. Rain in the morning and quite windy all day. The day did not seem like the Sabbath at home, where all is quiet and peace on this Sacred day. Soldiers were drilling all day. in the evening our Chaplain had Service in Fort Severn. I was on my road there, but was obliged to return with three patients of our Regt. to the Hospital. I was detained there some time and was unable to hear the Sermon.  Two men were arrested to day suspected of being spies, and placed in the Guard house for examination and trial.  29 Warm and pleasant. the balance of our Regiment (3 Companies) arrived safely this morning all in good spirits. a few on the sick list and one man with a broken clavicle. we dressed it and sent him to the Hospital. we are now waiting for our Uniforms which we expect
12  in a few days, then I hope we will move on to Washington. The engineers of our Camp and soldiers are making a Rail Road from Camp to the R. R. Depot, through this place, for the transportation of Soldiers, baggage etc. to Washington. troops are still arriving daily. At 9 P.M. we were called to arms by the beating of drums, it was rumored that the guards on duty were attacked, but it proved to be a false alarm. all were ready for any emergency in a very few minutes and formed into companies ready to march and meet the enemy if there was one to be found. orders were soon given to march to quarters when all was still in a short time. wrote J. C. and J. M.  30 Day very cold and stormy. we moved our quarters from No 5. to No 7. to make room for another Hospital. the building we occupy is a fine three story brick House new, and was used by one of the Proff's of the Naval School. To day I noticed the Boston Artillerists drilling.   they are very quick in all their movements, and are able to do much execution in a short time. The Penna. troops are learning to drill very well and will soon be able to drill with any of the N.Y. or Mass. Regiments, we are very much in need of our equipments for our troops. we look rather shabby and I am ashamed that it is so, but thank God we have brave hearts and are willing to do as much for our noble Country as the best uniformed troops in the world.
13  May, 1861  1 Day very cold and stormy. we were compelled to have fire made in the house, it was very cold indeed. Col. Ellsworth's Zouaves, of N.York arrived to day by Steamer Baltic. Camp quiet, very little going on more than regular military drill and camp life.  2 Still cool and windy. Col. E's Zouaves were landed to day 1100 strong, also the 5th Regiment of N. Y. both Regiment were shipped to Washington, those Zouaves are all fine men and are the hardest crowd I ever seen. they done a great amount of stealing and damaged property to a considerable extent in the Camp and in Annapolis, and was here but a few hours. all hands were glad when they left. Camp is and has been quiet all day. Drilling was attended to as usual.  3 Day unpleasant with rain and wind, very disagreeable indeed. Sent package to D.S.K. and P. Geddes. Am still kept busy with the sick. Nothing very serious on hand. Maj. Anderson arrived in Camp this evening, accompanied by an escort of armed men.  4 Still raining with snow, very unpleasant, afternoon clear and  moderating. the Uniforms of our Privates of the Regiment came this evening. Our men were very well pleased to know they had arrived.  5th Sunday. Pleasant. this morning the Uniforms were given to our troops. Considerable dissatisfaction exists among the men and officers, as regards the poor and miserable things our State has furnished for the men. I consider it really a shame and disgrace for Penna. to send our men such unbecoming uniforms. This morning after visiting the sick, I went to the Navy Chapel and heard the Episcopal Service read by the Chaplain of the 13th Regt of N. York. here I found drums piled around the pulpit and muskets standing all around the room. also knapsacks, canteens, cartridge boxes etc. lying on the floor in all directions. it looked quite different from home. while at Church here I went with Medicines in my pockets, Pistol and knife in another.
14  and with a woolen shirt on instead of a white one. 3120 troops arrived here to day by Boat from N. Jersey, and they were the best equipped men that has passed through this place. this evening I again went to the Chapel and heard our Chaplain S. W. McDaniel preach, he delivered an excellent discourse and good order was observed. it was truly a solemn sight to see the Soldiers lying, sitting and standing as best they could and listen to the sermon, all ready and equipped for actual service if necessary at a moments warning. Made out two certificates and discharged two of our soldiers Emory Hulton and O. P. Steele from Company H Capt. Snyder of Centre County, because they were in delicate health and unfit for duty.  6th Day unpleasant with rain. there was very little drilling done to day, on account of the rain and storms. There was another Schooner captured to day, having on board stores for the South.  7th Very pleasant and warm. To day in company with some of my friends I visited the Capitol buildings of Md. I stood on the same spot where the illustrious Washington stood when he resigned his Commission, the building is old and has not been change since, except the new furniture. I also came in possession of a piece of Canon or long tom, that was buried in the Bay for many years and now placed in the Capital.  8th Very warm but pleasant. the 20th Regt. of N. York arrived to day. they were not all equipped, and intend remaining here until they are fully uniformed. at 1/2 past 10 A.M. our Regt. was ordered off to Washington, at 12 N we all hurried up our regimentals, packed our trunks in double quick time, and was ready to move at the hour. we left the Annapolis Depot at 2 P.M. and was detained a great deal along the road. we arrived safely at Washington at 6 1/2 P.M. all along the road squads and

7th  The following description I found above this Cannon (or long tom) in the Capitol at Md. "It was presented to the State of Maryland by the Rev. Jos. Carburry Feb. 18th 1841. This is one of the Cannon brought to Md. by the first settlers under Lord Baltimore. It was taken out of St Mary's River in 1824, by Capt. Thomas Carbury. "The State presents it as a relic-link, connecting the past with the present."
15  companies of Soldiers were stationed to protect it from any Secessionists that might undertake to destroy the track. at the  Annapolis junction we found the 8th Regt. of N. York, stationed and encamped, a few miles beyond this on the Baltimore R. R. at the Relay House is another part of a Regt. stationed. all under the supervision of Genl. Bulter of Mass. The country  from Annapolis to Washington, is a barren and rough farming region, and not worth much money in my estimation. as we neared Washington, about five miles from the City I notice the beautiful residence of Clark Mills, the celebrated Sculptor, a few miles further on I noticed many fine residences and some few good farms. Our Regt. was cheered very heartily while marching into the City. part of our men were quartered in the Congregational Church. the balance in the Washington Assembly Rooms. Our Staff took rooms at the Lichan House. I retired to bed early, because I was very much fatigued. I had a matrass to sleep on for the first time since I left home, and the first time I took off my clothing to sleep.  9th Day very warm. I find it very dusty here and any Amt. of troops, there are now over 35000 soldiers here in and around this City. I was kept quite busy with the sick this morning. in the afternoon I dined with my friend C. M. Hall at Gautiers Saloon. we had a splendid dinner. afterwards took a walk to Willards Hotel and inspected where the fire was, this morning, also where Col. Ellsworths Zouves done such good service. then after that we took a ride in company with Jms A. Green to the Camp of the 7th Regt of N. York. while at Willards I had the pleasure of seeing Maj. Anderson also Senator Wilson of Mass. I also had the pleasure of seeing to day and conversed with Miss Dorothea Dix the Philanthropist.
16  She is a magnificent woman. She is now and always has been interested in the welfare of the soldiers. My uniform came to day.  my regimentals cost me about $80.  10th Unpleasant with rain. To day I dined with Jno. A. Green at Willards Hotel. we had a splendid dinner. I also had the pleasure of seeing Maj. Anderson again. Also the Hon. Carl Shurz. he is a sharp featured and fine headed German, and stands high as a Scholar and patriot. the city is very lively to day. wrote to M. P. K.  11th Very warm all day. this morning after visiting all the sick in the Regt. I toolk a walk up to and through the Presidents House, then to his stable and seen his span of horses that cost $2000. I also seen his carriage, all of which is of the best. then went through the public grounds, and I do think they are the handsomest that I have ever seen. I also seen Hon. Daniel Sickles house, and the place where he shot Key. also the tree which the ball lodged in. I cut off a piece of the bark, then I took a stroll to Washington's Monument yet unfinished. I examined the blocks of marble there. also the Copper block from Michigan weighing 2100 pounds and worth $1000 all there was presented by the different States and countries. all very fine and beautiful. the monument is now 174 feet high, and is being built by the Ladies of these United States. from there I returned to my quarters, after first trying my pistol, which proved good. in the evening I met Col. E. Z. Judson, better known as Ned Buntline, he says he has 1500 lumbermen on the road here from the northern part of N. York, all armed with Rifles and bowie knives, he himself commanding the whole force.
17  12th Sunday warm and sultry. in the morning I called to see a number of friends that are here from Penna. Some are soldiers and others citizens. in the afternoon our Chaplain preached to the Regiment. in the evening I went to the Unitarian Church and heard them play the Star Spangled Banner on the Organ. it was quite a treat.  13th Still quite warm. To day I visited the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. then I went to the War Department. then to the Presidents House, and had the pleasure of seeing the President and his Cabinet, A. Lincoln and  Son, the Hon's. Cameron, Chase, Seward, Bates, Smith, and Lehman Marshal of this District. Also Gov. Sprague of R. Island. they reviewed the troops belonging to this District. I paid but little attention to the soldiers, because I was more deeply interested in watching the countenances of this body of illustrious men. they all looked considerably care worn, and I was surprised to see they looked as well as they did. to night there was a large fire. said to be in Georgetown.  14th Day still warm. Our sick are doing right well. there is but that are any ways dangerous, those we sent to the Hospital. I have no news to record to day.   15th Day quite cool. To day we recieved two large boxes of underclothing and eatables from the Ladies and friends of Lewisburg. Could the donors of those things been eye witnesses to the reception of them by our boys, they would feel as if they had been paid ten fold.  Cheer after Cheer went up for the Ladies and Citizens of home for those gifts of kindness and usefulness. they fairly made the old church where they are temporarily quartered ring ready to burst its walls, a happier sett of boys never was seen, than on this occasion. At night I went to the Theatre along with others. wrote to J. [Schreyer], Priscilla and [Tom] Evans.
18  16th Day warm and pleasant. To day I visited the Capitol Buildings. I examined the building also the paintings etc. and was well pleased with my visit. I will not attempt to write a description of what I seen there, suffice it to say that the Capitol and grounds are magnificent, and it will amply pay any one to visit this massive structure. At present the Hall's of the Representatives and the Senate Chamber's, old and new, are now occupied as barrack for the Federal troops. Seats that were once, (and will again be) occupied by our learned Statesmen, are now used as seats for soldiers, some engaged in writing to the loved ones at home, some cleaning up their muskats, while others are amusing themselves by playing cards.  17th Very windy and dusty. This afternoon I visited the Smithsonian Institute. there I found a large and splendid collection of prepared Birds, Snakes, toads, fishes and Animals of all kinds. I also examined Stanley's picture Gallery, where I found a collections of portraits of all the Indian Chiefs for years past. among the number was the renowned Billy Bowlegs.  I also found a fine collection of chemical apparatus, most of it presented by Dr.  Robert Hare of Phil. the Library here is very large and contains works from all nations, and published in all Languages. I also noticed some very ancient paintings, some over 340 years old. Here I seen a large Metiorite from Mexico, weight 252 lbs. its composition is of Nickle and Iron. A curious dress is here exhibited, made out of furs, with a covering for the face, and is the one worn by Dr. Elisha Kent Kane in the Artic Regions. I could have spent days here and been interested, but my time was precious and having other duties I was compelled to go away without examining all on exhibition here.  18th Warm and pleasant. the Arms of our Regiment were examined to day by a United States Officer. in the evening there was considerable excitement in front of our quarters. it was caused by a man
19  residing here, and was a rank secessionist. he insulted a few of our soldiers, and they just arrested him and brought him to our quarters. there was a meeting held in regard to him and was sent to head quarters to have a further hearing. Our boys were very much excited about the matter and they shouted hang him, hang him, but our Officers interfered and took him in hands.  19th Sunday pleasant.

Last night about 10,000 of our troops were sent away from here to different sections of country. about 4000 went to Alexandria Virginia. Among the rest were Col. Ellsworths N. York Zouaves, proceeding up town. Col. E's saw a Secession flag waving over the Marshall House, kept by James Jackson, a well known Secessionist. Instantly entering the house, with four or five of his men, Col. E. proceeded to the house-top, tore down the flag, and trampled it under his foot. when he came down with the flag, Jackson shot Col. E. through the heart, he fell dead upon the stairs. he then shot at Brownell, a Zouave who was with Col. E. Brownell then discharged his musket into Jackson's brain, bayoneting his body as he fell, pinning it to the steps. There it laid up to 9 A.M., under a guard of Zouaves, who will permit no one to remove it. Col. E's body was immediately brought to Washington by six Zouaves in the Steamer James Guy.

Bulter marched to Sewells Point, near Alex. and attacked that place, killing 300 Secessionists and losing 80 of his own men. the War has no doubt commenced in earnest. our Regiment are anxious to show their bravery also, and I am sure will do good execution.  26 Sunday.

Oh sister will you meet me,  Oh sister will you meet me,  Oh sister will you meet me,  On Canaans happy shore.  Yes Brother we will meet you. (3 times Repeat) On Canaans happy shore.
23  This hymn is and has been quite a favorite amongst us all ever since we left home. we have sang it wherever we have been, and sing it still and I hope may continue to sing it as long as we live. when we left Harrisburg in the Cars, not knowing our destination and but poorly prepared for battle in case we met the enemy, it was sung with a feeling heart and the conscience of doing our Country's service. I must confess it brought more tears to my eyes than any other hymn I have ever helped to sing. it was new to me, and it still is fresh in my memory, and I often find myself singing it. I really love it. It is Simple and pure. Hospital duties were not so pressing to day.

24  June Continued.  5th Still raining and continued all day and night. The Companies sent out as Scouts yesterday have returned to Camp and others have gone in their place. the cause of all this is, that there are a great many Maryland Secessionists lurking about Bladensburg, waiting for a favorable opportunity to attack us. we are watching them carefully and will arrest them as soon as they show their colors. to night our Lewisburg Infantry went, all but 7 who were left as guards to their tents. the rain came down in torrents when they left and continued all night.

Road. we traveled the waggon road, and I suppose that is twice as far as by R. R. we frequently found the Road blockaded by the Rebels. we had 250 pioneers and in a short time they would make new Roads for all to pass. the Country we passed through is a barren mountainous and unproductive region. very well timbored. the crops are very poor. Corn many places not two feet high. Oats short and wheat very scarce.  we were within 6 miles of Occaquaw. On our march to day, a musket was discharged and accidentally killed an Artillery man of the U.S.A.  18th Day very pleasant and warm. This morning our men brought in several Rebels and one Negro. One of the men was an Alabamian and was a member of Capt. W. L. Gordons Company and was enlisted for 12 months. he told us that a party of 33 men from his Company were the men that attacked our Picket Guard at Pikes Run 2 miles from our Camp. his name is Alex. G. Smith. on that
35  night he says they lost 8 of their men at this attack, this is 4 more than we knew of before. At noon we recd. orders to get ready to march at a moments notice. we waited patiently untill 5 P.M. before we started with our Brigade we marched 6 miles and then encamped for the night near Centreville. we moved to this point very cautiously, as Tyler's men had been fighting here to day against the Rebels. our men fought bravely, what the loss is on each side I am unable to say. Genl. Tyler's conduct was condemned here by the men. he had advanced farther than he was ordered to do. we marched in silence for two miles. we encamped on a hill and was surrounded by about 40,000 troops. our whole division is here now, and all under the Command of Genl. McDowell. The fires in the different Camps look beautiful, for miles around you can see them and it looks to my eye as if the earth was imitating the skies and trying to have stars too.  19th Morning Cool and pleasant. Our men are very much depressed in spirits this morning, on account of having no rations. they were promised to us sure, but as yet they are not to be had. many of our men has had nothing to eat for two days. I myself have eaten nothing but hard crackers, and drank coffee for sometime. our provision train is behind some where. I ascertained that the loss of our men yesterday was 60 killed, wounded and missing. all was under the Command of Genl. Tyler. he had to Retreat. he is severely reprimanded for disobeying orders. he was to remain at Centreville but went two miles beyond and was attacked and inhumanely treated by the Rebels, when they attacked their masked Batteries at Bulls Run 1 1/2 miles from Centreville. the Rebels fired Grape and bomb-shells. the fight lasted about 3 hours. Today I visited the wounded and sick of yesterdays work. they are all at Centreville in Churches and houses. the Citizens of the place have all left.
36  I also attended the funeral of a Wisconsin Volunteer. Genl. Tyler's, Brigade consisted of the Wisconsin 1st, Ohio 2nd , Mass. 9th and New York 69th. the talk to day is growing more severe on Tyler for his wreckless conduct and carelessness. Tyler's skirmishers had told him twice that they discovered masked batteries ahead. he ordered them in again. the Rebels allowed the Scouts to pass, and when the troops had fairly entered the pass at this place, the Rebels fired on them and mowed them down like grass.  I visited Centreville to day and found the Citizens had nearly all fled. those that remained claimed to be strong Union men. I also visited one of the Rebel Forts. they are generally very poorly constructed, and I am satisfied they never calculated to make a stand at any of these places, but had them to serve as decoys to us, and coax us on farther into their strongholds.  It was very laughable and amusing to see the men of the different Regiments killing cattle for the use of the men. Ellsworths Zouaves slaughtered a dozen or more at night. they are the greatest adventurers in the whole Service. they are always on the go, they are very useful in many ways. Good natured and obliging.  20th Morning very hot and sultry. Our Picketts brought in a number of Rebel prisoners this morning. among the number was a member of the Black Horse Cavalry, he says at the Battle on Thursday at and along by Centreville, our men killed 300 Rebels, besides wounding a great number. he also says they are suffering very much for the want of water and provisions. they are now living on Rice, and they are very sickly, having Small Pox, measles and Fevers. Our Picketts were firing at all hours last night. we have everything guarded for miles around us. the Rebels are deserting their ranks very fast and are anxious to join us and fight for us, and their officers are fearing it very much. we also hear from all the prisoners that they are suffering very much from
37  disease at Manassas Junction. I went within 1 1/2 miles of the Fort at Bulls Run. it looks like a very dreary place. it is reported that their breast works at this place is a 1/4 mile in length. This evening we recd. orders for the whole column to march at 6 P.M. before that hour came, the order was countermanded and three days rations was distributed to all the men whose time had not expired. The term of enlistment of our Regiment having expired to day, we were honorably discharged from Service by Genl. McDowell. The following is the order, No. 37, also ordered back to Camp Hale Vir.  July 20th 1861  "The General Commanding has learned with regret that term of Service of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment of Volunteers is about to expire. The Services of this regiment have been so important, its good Conduct so general, its patience under privations so Constant, its State of efficiency so good, that the departure of the regiment at this time can only be considered an important loss to the Army."  Brigadier General McDowell  Camp at Centreville, Virginia.
38  21st Sunday. This morning at 4 A.M. our Regiment (being discharged yesterday morning from service.) started back to Camp Hale at Fort Ellsworth, where we arrived safely at 2 P.M. after having a march of 25 miles, through the heat and dust. Our men offered to stay a few days longer if there was to be a fight that soon, but Genl. McDowell refused their staying, unless they would remain two weeks. the men took a vote, and the Maj. carried for going home in preference to staying two weeks. I could not blame the men for what they did do, because they had been badly treated during their whole term of Service, not only by Government, but by many of their officers, and they said they were honorably dismissed from Service, and they had written that they would be home at the end of three months, and they had left their businesses all unsettled. so they would go, and go they did. after we had travelled several hours we heard Canonading behind. we were all considerably surprised to hear it, because when we left Centerville it was generally understood through Camp that there would be no attack made on Bull Run for several days yet, as all things was not ready. that they were waiting for a train that would bring combustible material to burn the woods, and Mortars to shell the batteries. Many of our men wanted to go back, and another vote was taken, but carried to go to Camp Hale, and if necessary then to go back they would. we had not been in Camp long untill all things were as busy as usual.  This evening we had an alarm at Camp. Our men were up and in arms ready for any emergency in a few minutes.  22nd Unpleasant. The news that we recieved last night from Centreville that a battle had taken place is confirmed this morning. the news is very contradictory and unsatisfactory. Some say we have driven the Rebels from their strong holds, others say that
39  we are badly defeated. the latter I believe, because our men are passing us here all the time for Washington and they all say they dont know where there regiments are. I dressed the wounds of a great many Soldiers of different regiments and they all tell sorrowful tales of the manner they were advanced by many of the officers. I am confident Genl. McDowell has hurried these movements. I seen him on Saturday evening in company with Senator MacDougal of California and I am confident they with many others were intoxicated. I took our sick men to Washington this evening, in order to have them ready for to accompany the regiment home in the Cars to morrow. Rained hard all day and night.  23rd Day pleasant and warm. Our regiment left Camp Hale this morning and came to Washington. Another alarm kept our men up all night. at Washington we halted a few hours at the Lichan House, then went to the Baltimore Depot. The news from Bull Run is more favorable for us than we heard yesterday. the panic stricken soldiers are straggling in from all directions. we did not get off from Washington until 8 P.M. our ride was an unpleasant and tedious one. the train made very poor headway. we arrived at Baltimore at 2 A.M. and remained there the ballance of the night.  24th This morning we left Baltimore at 1/4 before 8 A.M. for Harrisburg where we reached at night. again making poor time, the scenery and country from Baltimore here is beautiful. when we passed the line between Md. and Pa. three hearty cheers were given for our good old State. the treatment we had recieved from her hands was all forgotten, and allowances had been made for her, because at the time we left home there was no system established, and now she is doing as well if not better for her Sons, than her Sister States.
40  I readily noticed the difference in the appearance of our grain fields, the cleanliness of our farms, from those in the States we just came from.  25th Very warm. Harrisburg is crowded with soldiers. many are arriving for the three years Service, and the three months men are being discharged as fast as they can muster them out of service, and all say the majority of their men will return to the war. I find a great deal of dissatisfaction exists among the Volunteers and officers on account of the Pay Masters being behind in their duties. All want to be discharged paid off and get home. Many have been here a week and are not yet discharged, nor paid off.  26th Harrisburg is all in excitement, more troops are arriving every train, both ways. we all fear a riot here on account of the pay of the Volunteers. we are promised our discharge to morrow.  27th Day pleasant and warm. Our Regiment were Mustered out of service to day, but recieved no pay as yet, except our own Lewisburg Infantry. they were paid off in full by an arrangement of our own with the pay master. we all left Harrisburg for home at 1:40 P.M. where we arrived at 5 P.M. we were welcomely recd. at the Depot by the Citizens, both Ladies and Gentlemen, the Military, Engine Companies etc. after parading the streets we were halted in Market Square and had an address from Wm. Van Gozer Esqr. he was replied to by Capt. Chamberlin. we were greeted with cheers from the Citizens and kisses from the Ladies. We were then dismissed and went to our homes and recieved the Congratulations of our families.  I never witnessed a more solemn scene than on this occasion. it was tears of joy that moistened the cheeks of a many a sun burnt soldier. we all lived to get back home. of our Company,

Wool in the procession. thousands were in attendance. afterwards went to Camp Welsh, where I found our men and all glad to see me.  25 Day cold, a heavy frost this morning. we prescribed for upwards of 75 men to day. we have nothing very serious in Camp. our location is a beautiful one and is located along the Bladensburg turnpike and one mile from the Capitol. on the same ground that the late Genl.

I was shown the place where Cilly was killed. we are close by Fort Lincoln.

Howard Inspected our Regt. to day, and was very well pleased with the appearance and good discipline of our Regt. I visited Bladensburg to day and found it a small and insignificant place. Our County and district Elections have all proved favorable and successful to the Republican cause.  November 1861  1st Day Pleasant and warm. in the forenoon I went to Washington and sent our Hospital Stores to Camp. evening it rained and stormed furiously.  2nd Day very unpleasant.

Genl. Howard. we forded the Eastern Branch of the Potomac at Bladensburg. we stopped at night in a woods close by Centreville Md. an insignificant place of 1/2 doz. houses. after marching 16 miles. it was hard marching for the men. So much mud and sand.  4th Day pleasant. this morning we started on our march at daylight. passed through upper Marlborough, a rank Secession hole, and County Seat of Prince George's County. and halted at Hills Landing for dinner. on the Patuxent River, took my dinner aboard a schooner.  After crossing the River we passed through Anne Arundle County, and stopped beyond Smithville 2 miles, in Grahams Woods.
51  where we encamped for the night, with "terra firma" for our beds and the Heavens for a covering. this day we marched 22 miles. Many of the men gave out, as the roads are very sandy and hilly. the Country is very barren and many farms. the soil is exhausted, the chief production is tobacco and negros. Persimmons are very plenty, Grain fields are scarce.  5th Day cool and pleasant. after starting this morning I learned that we were in Calvert County, this region of country looks better, and parts of it has the appearance of Penna. land. but not at all like Penna. farming. Comfortable Houses and barns are very scarce. We arrived at Prince Frederick, the County Seat of Calvert Co. about 3 P.M. where we halted for the night, a distance of 13 miles, from our last encampment. 50 of our Regt. and a Squadron of Harlan's Cavalry went on to St. Lennans, 13 miles farther. I find our business on this expidition is to sustain the Union men and guard the Election districts which (Election) takes place to morrow. I noticed but a few smiling faces on our arrival here. after a little enquiry I found out a few good union people here. So 6 of us stopped with a good Union and law abiding man, the Rev. Mr. Hawley of the Methodist Church. here I also met a Rev. Wm. Laney and the Venerable Rev. Wilson all of the same persuasion. we were treated very kindly by these men, and well taken care of.  6th Morning unpleasant with rain. first thing our boys done this morning was to raise the Stars and Stripes upon a pole on the Court House, where a few days ago a Secesh flag floated. State and district Election came off to day. all passed off pleasantly until about 11 A.M. when an Ex-member of Congress Col. A. R. Sollers became a little noisy and threatened terrible things to the Union men. he exhibited a bowie knife, and was about insulting a Union man, when our Col. had him arrested and placed under guard. this created considerable excitement. it was soon quelled however, and things moved along smoothly again for a few hours. but as King Whiskey is always about in this Country
52  it was evident more trouble was on hand, and as these men showed it. they would be arrested, these Secessionists at heart. (although they denied it.) made a great many promises etc. to keep the peace, but it was no use, they were kept under arrest untill the election was over, when all were left go. but 5 of the worst, those we took care of in quarters untill morning. one was suspected of attempting to poison our men, as he was caught putting something of a white nature in the Camp kettles while the men were cooking. the Polls closed at 6 P.M. there was 200 votes polled. many of the voters came as far as 22 miles, and all go on horseback. our coming here has done much for the Union Cause. I learn we are only 20 miles from Port Tobacco. I also heard one of our Prisoners say he was Col. in the Rebel Army.  we all doubt it.  7th Morning pleasant. we left here and started back for our Camp, having accomplished our Mission. we took our 5 prisoners with us and encamped for the night at Grahams Woods.  8th Pleasant and cool with a heavy frost. Genl. Howard after examining our prisoners left 4 off on their taking the Oath of Allegiance, the 5th one Col.

Stopped again at Centreville.  9th Morning cold and damp. we arrived safely at our Camp at 1 P.M. found many of our Men very sick that we had left behind and two dying. a gun was accidentally discharged and shot a private through the Arm, not seriously injured however. it rained hard all afternoon and evening. Our Regiment has recd. the praise wherever we have been of being the best disciplined Regt. that has passed over this same route. Col. Welsh deserves much praise for his good control of his men.  I had almost forgotten to say that our Brigade was scattered around through this Southern Md. at the different Election Precincts.
53  10th Sunday, day cool. a colored man, a cook in Co. D. died in our Regt. to day of Pneumonia. Since our return from the March I find nearly 100 of our men sick. it was too much for the first attempt. the Michigan 1st buried two of their men to day, and the N. Hampshire 5th buried one. it was a solemn and imparing sight. this is a very unhealthy locality for a Camp, being in a Malarious district. we have now on hand, Typhoid Fever, Pneumonia, Measles, Small Pox, Dysentery, Diarrhea and Catarrh Patients.  11th Day more pleasant and quite warm. we are kept very busy now with the sick of our Regt. we have now on hand 140 sick and many are very ill.  12th Still warm and pleasant. to day we had quiet a good many lady visitors, who brought us luxurius and dainties for our sick.  13th Day Comfortable.

Sick still improving.  17th Sunday. very cold and stormy all day. Dr Potter and myself very busy with the sick. we are now feeling more encouraged, as the list is on the decrease and many are Convaliscent, the Col. has promised to move us to a more healthy locality. Thomas Dickson died of Consumption Co. K.  18th Day Still Cold and windy. we sent 10 of our men to Genl. Hospital, as the Regt. moves to day to a more healthy Camp, two miles distant, nearer Washington City.
54  19th Day more pleasant and warm. this Afternoon an order came to our new Camp ordering us to strike our tents and be ready to march to the Cars with 3 days rations, to go to Baltimore and there take the Steamboat for Fortress Monroe. when the boys heard this news they took off their hats and gave three hearty cheers for the good news. all were ready long before the appointed time. we left in the cars at midnight. in consequence of this change we sent 21 more men to the Genl. Hospital, who we considered unfit to stand the journey. they will follow when able to do active duty.  Mary E. Walls was Married to Jos. Bucher this evening at Lewisburg.  20th Day very pleasant and warm. we reached Baltimore at 11 A.M. where our men were breakfasted by the Relief Association. we sent  our men, stores and baggage aboard the Steamboat Pochahontas, Capt. Charles, at 5 P.M.  sett our faces southward, on the bosom of the Noble Chesapeake, our band playing one National airs after another. I retired early, because I had a billious attack.  21st Morning beautiful. I am feeling better. I went on deck of our boat and kept a sharp look out for sights, but as there was little to be seen away from Porpoisis, and millions of Canvassback ducks. I soon went below again. at 11 A.M. we were hailed by the "Dawn" a gun boat belonging to the blockading Squadron. She shot across our bow which was a warning to us to stop, and say who and what we were. it was out from the Mouth of the Rappahannock. She came along side, and asked for Newspapers and gave us her Mail. we gave all the papers we had. She bid us go on and we parted with our friend. at 2 P.M. we came in sight of Fortress Monroe, and at 4 P.M. we landed safely at the Wharf below. we soon  unloaded all our effects and marched to our Camp ground, 1 mile from the Fort and along side of Mill Creek, and two from Hampton- now in ruins. it was late at night before we had all our tents pitched. we soon went to bed.
55  22nd Day lovely. this morning I arose at daylight and to my surprise I seen the Robin and Blue jay sporting around on the bushes, and heard them sing their cheerful dittys. it reminded me of home on a May Morning in our own beautiful Buffalo Valley. was very busy all day putting up our tents and opening our Hospital Stores.  23rd Morning Cool. had a light rain last night, but at 10 A.M. all was warm and cheerful again. was visited to day by a great many old friends and College Classmates from the Army and Navy. there are here now over 15000 Soldiers, and more coming daily. we are 6 miles from Sewells Point, where there is 12000 Rebels, 20 miles from Yorktown where Genl's Magruder and Bragg are with 25000 more Rebels. we are 80 miles from Richmond by land. New Port News is ten miles distant, where Genl. Mansfield has Command and in our possession. Craney Island is 14 miles distant and in the hands of the Rebels. they are to be seen with a glass, and it looks as if they were well fortified.  24th Sunday, morning lovely. went to the town and then visited Fort Monroe. there is room here for 300 Guns. the place is lovely, and is well built. in the Parade Ground I noticed a great many live Oaks. they are a beautiful ever green. the Fort is one mile in Circumference. the ditch or  is 100 feet wide and 6 feet deep and outside of this is a heavy water battery. I here noticed the Union and Floyd Guns. the Union is Mounted and ready for action, and weighs 52005 lbs. the Floyd Gun is lying close by on the Ground and weighs 49099 lbs. it costs Government $25 every time they make a full charge with this Gun. they are Massive pieces of Metal. the Bore is large enough to allow a man to Crawl in.  25th Day more cool. I was busy all day making out descriptive list of discharged soldiers, and forwarding them to Washington. I came across more of my College Classmates, now in the Navy.
56  26th Day pleasant and warm. nothing occurred to day of any great interest, more than Genl. Wool reviewed our Regiment, he complimented us very highly for our good disciplined and appearance  of the men.  27th Day more cool. our Servant went out along the beach to day and gathered a fine mess of Oysters and Clams. wrote a number of letters home.  28th day lovely and warm. this is the day appointed by the Governor of our State as a General Thanksgiving. we here at this place, went through our regular routine of drill etc. we had an extra dinner, plenty of Oysters, beef steak, Sweet Potatoes etc. Our men are enjoying much better health, than at any time since we are a Regt.  29th Day pleasant. very little doing to day.

57  December. 1861.  1st Sunday, pleasant and warm. Our Chaplin preached an excellent Sermon to day to the Regiment. Sick doing very well.  2nd Day Stormy. visited the Fort. this morning we heard very heavy firing at daylight, it continued nearly 5 hours. I afterwards  heard that there was an attack made on a Rebel Vessel by some of our Tug Boats. how it terminated I have not heard. in the evening it commenced hailing then snow and rain. I notice that Changes are very sudden in this climate.  3rd This morning when I awoke I was surprised to find the ground covered with snow and ice. it is now very cold and unpleasant, and storming quite hard. I sympathized with our Sentinels last night, they had an unpleasant night of it. Continued cold all day and very disagreeable. Considerable Pickett firing at 10 at night.  4 Morning again pleasant and moderating very fast. Our Camp was very agreeably and unsuspectedly surprised this morning by the appearance of Maj. J. B. Oakley, Paymaster of the U.S. Army, who paid off all our men up to the 1st Nov. 1861- I recd. but 10 days pay from the 20th Oct. up to 1st Nov. 1861- amounting to $44.75 I was ordered to duty on the 12th Oct. So I loose I suppose 8 days pay. and have  recieved no mileage at all. I suppose however our State will pay me the 8 days.  5 Day very pleasant and warm. this morning we recd. orders to pack up all our effects, and be ready to strike our tents early to morrow morning, and take passage aboard Steamers now lying waiting for us at the Fort, for Port Royal S.C. this was a gain welcome news to us.  the boys have been sending large amounts of money home to day to their friends etc.  6th We arose at 4 A.M. Struck our tents, and marched to the landing below the Fort. three of our Companies under the Command of our Lieut. Col. went on board the Steamer Illinois. I had charge of the Med. Department. This is a splendid Steamer and has been running to California from N. York since 1851  She is 2800
58  tons birthen, her Captain is Wm. Rathborne. the ballance of our Regt. was under Col. Welshs charge and they went on board the Steamboat Cosmopolitan. Col. Powers 76th Regt. Pa.Vol. had been put on the Illinois the day before. at 11 A.M. we hoisted our Anchor and the massive wheels were put in motion. we said good bye to the bal. of our regt. and we were soon on our voyage towards "Dixie".  as we passed the Steamers Minnesota and Roanoke, that are lying anchored here, we were cheered heartily by their crews. the Roanoke complimented us by having their Band play the National Airs, we gave them three times three hearty cheers, (such as loyal sons can give) and then they Manned the rigging of their vessel, which was a splendid sight to see the Sailors climbing up theses ropes like squirrels going up a tree. we were afterwards saluted by the firing of cannon from Fortress Monroe. this was the way we left old Point Comfort, the ballance of our regiment left at 4 P.M. we soon passed Cape Henry, and left the quiet waters of the Chesapeake and entered the more boisterous one of the Mighty Atlantic. night soon came on, and as I fell rather singular about the head, I concluded the best place for me was in bed. So I retired early as did the most of us, in order that we might escape if possible becoming sea sick. at 10P.M. I heard considerable noise on deck. I inquired into this and heard we were halted by the Monticello one of the blockading Squadron. She found out what we was and our destination and then bid us good night, and left us to the mercy of the wind and the wave, at 3 A.M. we passed Cape Hatteras. this is always a rough place. I slept soundly until 4 A.M.  7th  I arose early this morning and went on deck and remained there untill breakfast was ready. in the meantime I again witnessed the most magnificent sight my eyes ever beheld. it was Sunrise at Sea. the whole waters appeared to be on fire. I also discovered that "Navy land" was to be Sun. I was very much surprised to learn that but few of our men became Sea Sick all stood it so far nobly. after eating a hearty breakfast I again went on deck and with the Aid of the Spy Glass I noticed many vessels under full sail, bound for different Ports. it just now struck 6 bells. (11 A.M.) day lovely, sea calm, and we are making good headway, and off the Coast of
59  North Carolina, the Captain just ordered his subordinate to try the water, this was done by dipping up a bucket full and thrusting a thermometer into it, to see if we had yet struck the Gulf Stream, he says we are now in the Gulf Stream. Our boys are all well and happy as larks, all are now enjoying the Sweet Strains of the Violins and banjos, that are on board, and all are being as well executed as I ever heard them. Oh! it is delightful to take a trip on the briny Ocean. Afternoon and evening passed away pleasantly to all. retired early.  8th Sunday. Morning lovely and waves rolling high, at 4A.M. we were all aroused from our slumbers by the Cry of Fire, Fire. You can imagine with what a horror these words came to our ears. in an instant the dear ones at home flashed through my brain, a watery grave, being burnt up alive etc, was the thoughts of a moment. I jumped out of bed immediately and upon enquiry I learned that it was an unnecessary alarm, I returned again to my berth and took a quiet nap, untill the Gong Sounded, when I arose went on deck and had the satisfaction of seeing a number of large sized Sharks, that were Swimming after our Vessel. at 10A.M. the Captain told us we were opposite Charleston S.C. Soon after we noticed three large vessels going the same direction, with Stars and Stripes floating in the breeze. at 12M. we heard the Sound of Cannon, as we are still out of sight of land we did not know from "whence it came etc". about this time, there was a Scuffle on board between the Captains Mate, and a deck hand. the latter struck the former, when the mate knocked the latter down, with a Mace, which cut his Scalp open and he bled profusely, they then handcuffed him to an iron on deck, to await further punishment at some future day. at 15 Min. of 1P.M. we came in sight of land along the Coast of S.C. which was good news to many on board, especially those that had been troubled with Sea Sickness. For my part I cannot say that I am tired, I really enjoy being on the Ocean when pleasant. at 4-P.M. we came in sight of Hilton Head. the Pilot Flag was hoisted. (blue Ground with Stars on it.) and we were soon
60  Supplied with a Tug boat that was to guide us into the Harbor, but unfortunately we were ran aground a 6 P.M. Our Pilot did not understand his business, the sea was rough and we had an uncomfortable time of it untill 11 P.M. when the tide rose again and floated us off, and we made for deeper water, and then Anchored for the night. the Captain had thrown up Rocketts as a Signal for assistance but none came untill morning, when we were supplied with a good Pilot, who steered our vessel into the Harbor safely. thus we passed the most uncomfortable 5 hours that I ever experienced. Such a snapping and cracking of ship timbers, and a continual bumping and rolling of the vessel was anything but pleasant to land sailors, even those belonging to the boat were very much alarmed and gave us but little consolation. I just laid down on a sofa untill it was all over. I then went to bed. with it all our men behaved very well and put on their best looks while others were differently engaged, some Crying, others praying, some singing and others Cursing. with it all there was a number of amusing sights. and none more so, than this, a number of the men had been playing cards all afternoon for Sulters Tickets, (which is passable for goods and equivalent to money with their Sulters) so when this storm arose and it was fully decided upon by many of them that we would all be shipwrecked. it was laughable to see these chaps who had won these thickets, hunting up the ones they had won them from and making them take the tickets back, crying at the same time. the Cards were all thrown overboard or otherwise destroyed. thus ended my first trip aboard a large Steamer on the Mighty deep, a greater variety is seldom if ever experienced on so short a trip by any one. I am pleased with my trip and it has certainly gave me a good idea of Ocean travelling.  9th Morning bright and pleasant. at an early hour our vessel was under full headway and at 8 A.M. our Anchor again dropped and we were safely quartered within speaking distance of our men aboard the Cosmopolitan. we gave each other three cheers.
61  All are feeling as merry as if nothing had happened of a serious nature. I learned on our trip the reason why we were put on this Vessel. the 76th Regt. Pa. Vol. have not yet recieved their Arms, and our three Companies were put on here to guard them in case of any intrusion from the Rebel forces. I am sorry to say that our Services were not more highly appreciated by them. we not only guarded them but acted as guards aboard the boat, and with it all it proved a thankless favor. we will certainly remember them as showing us but little Courtesy. they cared but little for our Comfort. (a few of then were a little more Considerate) I notice some 60 vessels of all classes now lying in this Harbor. I notice is is very warm here and sultry. In the evening Genl. Sherman ordered our regiment to be divided. 5 Companies under Col. Welsh go to Otter Island. the Med. department to be under Dr. Potter. it is about 40 miles from here by water and along the Atlantic Coast. the other 5 Companies go to Fort Seward, (once Fr. Beauregard.) at Bay Point on Eddings Island, opposite to Hilton Head, and about 3 miles across the Port Royal Harbor. we were all very much disappointed in being separated. Lieut. Col. Beaver has Command of there 5 Companies, and I have the charge of the Med. department, and am acting Surgeon of the Post. I enjoyed a ride to day around the vessels  in the Harbor.  10th Morning pleasant and very warm. the Steamboat Delaware loaded on our Stores and men from the Illinois and Cosmopolitan. while they were doing this I went ashore to Hilton Head, and visited Fort Wells, (once Ft. Walker.) I went all through the Fort, and noticed the place where Dr. Buist was found by our men after the taking of this Fort. he was covered up with sand and killed by the bursting of a shell. he was engaged in dressing the wounds of a soldier when he was killed. I afterwards visited the Express Office of Adams and Co. also the Post Office etc. we went ashore in a novel way, the tide being low,
A Sermon on Bachelors and other things.  Ladies and Gentlemen.  The last time we assembled on dis creek, it fell to my lot to make a few brief remarks, on matters and things in general, which was - received with marked attention, amidst great applause and laughter, so much so, that I was afraid it would be necessary to hold a coroners conquest on de mortal remains of some ob de breddern dat was present on dat ever memorable occasion. Since dat time I hab often thought how fortunate we was, to make our external escape from de rapids of dat most beautiful stream dat we generally call "Penns Creek" after dat good old man who settled dis Colony dat we have de honor to reside in. I had concluded never to speak any more on sich tick'lar Casions, but de committee of de night watch was to see me a few weeks ago, and declared most positively, that I must prepare a speech for dis occasion, and consequently I thought I would, and as my memory is somewhat embarrassed by my late love serape, and the removal of my darling Katarine Mavourneenfishy to parts unknown, I took it for granted that you would bear with me, in  this most trying time of my wounded and heart stricken affliction. I am getting over it, very slowly. often, yes, very often does the tears trickle down my cheeks, about as large as Shanghai berries, it was an awful stroke for one not accustomed to disappointments, but such is life, as fast as you build your castles, there will always be plenty of gals to pull them down. I will now proceed with my discourse in a mild manner.
My Heavens: The text which I have chosen, from which to sermonize you to day, is said, by learned men, to have composed the first verse of a love song, sung by our great paternal ancestor Adam, a short time previous to his fall, as he roved in loveliness through the ambrosial bowers of Paradise. Of the truth of the assertion, I cannot vouch - My own memory running back but a short time previous to my birth.  But, to the text - to some of you it may not only appear (as I am disposed to think it really is) indivisible and consolidated - to most of you, the precursor of doubled and twisted thunder, hauky beyond all comprehension. Yes, you hard-hearted, cross-grained, ill-begotten, turkey-trodden unnatural woman hating everlasting old pests you! why dont you marry, and be somebody. I'm going to give you double dis tilled thunder, and rub it in with a corn cob saturated with spirits of turpentine and extra distilled elixer of vitriol stewed down by slow degrees of forty-five times stronger than newly issued chain lightning! Ye hardened sinners! I might as well attempt to coax's a mice's tail from a half fed tom cat, as to instill a moral lesson under your shirts by mild persuasion, or the emollient influences of my oleagenious eloquence. - There you be your faces fast losing the glow and freshness of manhoods vigorous days: the time-scarred monuments of your own misery. Poor, wretched, forlorn travellers to the land of deep despair, without a decent shirt to wear, and where woman's sweet snarling voice is never heard, and babies dwell not! You remind me of Hitesmans old horse what wouldn't go to water till he died for want of it. You dont know the sweets of married
62  we were carried ashore on the back of a negro. when we returned we were hauled out in a Cart to the boat. the Sand is very deep. the birds are singing sweety and it is uncomfortably warm. we go to Bay Point to relieve the 79th Regt. N.Y. Vols. we landed at this place at 1 P.M. we were all taken ashore with lighters, as our Steamboat could not get close to shore for the many shoals. there are no wharves here, at any of these points, but are now being built. we find things here in a bad condition, very filthy indeed.  11th Day very warm and sultry. men are bathing here in the Ocean. it is very comfortable, and linen clothing would be very acceptable here. Our men are busy to day cleaning up their quarters etc. I have had placed in my charge two sick Secessionists, one with Pneumonia, his name is John Lewis, the other had his arm shot off at the engagement here. it was then Amputated. his name is John Cruise, both are from Whippee Swamp, Prince William Parish, South Carolina. they belonged to Co. D. of the 9th Regt. S.C. Vol's. I have also in charge a Private of the 79th Regt. N.Y. Vol's. (Highlander.) with Confluent Small Pox. I gathered some fine shells to day, also some Secesh trophies.  we are located very pleasantly here at the terminus of Broad and Port Royal Rivers, where they empty into the Atlantic Ocean and form this Port Royal Harbor. Fort Seward has 17 heavy Guns, one bursted during the engagement here and Killed several Rebels, the one half is still lying on top of the Fort, and the ballance has never been found. it was a new Rifled Gun and made in Virginia. Their Magazines are all well filled with Ammunition. they Commenced this Fort last March, before Lincoln asked for troops. it was ready for the Guns in July.  there was 1000 soldiers guarding this Fort all the time, and were Commanded by Capt. Elliott, and all the troops here and at Hilton Head were under Genl. Drayton. We have also another small Fort in our charge about 1 1/2 miles farther up the Coast, with 5 guns, and have one Company there.
life because you have not tried 'em, and you have not tried 'em because you did not happen to know 'em beforehand. Dis question once more refreshes my olfactory organs, in de kase between my self individually and my intended better half Katarine Mavourneenfishy. we was so near joining hands in holy Padlock and connubial joy and felicity, dat I was jist a gwine to embrace her, when we differed a small trifle in our understanding, just one simple word between us, and on dat one word we could not agree.I axed her would she have me for better or for worser, and she positively came out as bold as a sheep and said, and said - NO. My feelings can be imagined better than expressed. My Hearers. 2 times secondly: I might quote various passages of hearsay to prove to you the necessity of getting a wife, but I forbear, lest some of you should take to quoting the dictionary when the urgency of your cases requires that your time should be spent in holding the galls. Now I hinted in the outset that my text was indivisable; but I find, upon reflection that they are two heads to it, and that these two heads constitute two persons, or rather, one person and one thing namely:  1st A married man, or person,  2nd A Bachelor, or thing.  A married man is a person to all intents and purposes, while a bachelor is a thing beyond all doubt. Seeing therefore, that my text is capable of divisions, I have divided it; and will describe a Bachelor, or thing, descant upon the position relative, moral, and social, which he occupies in society, next describe a married man, or person, run a comparison between a married man, and a thing; and finally extort generally.
1st Of a Bachelor.  A Bachelor, my friends, is a mixtry; a compound of selfishness and nonsense, and he constitutes the narrative extervation, or hungus fungus, of what is called the tail end of a God's intelligent creation. Without a single sparse of the fervent fire of true, manly love, to warm hyperborean heart; he stands in society the miserable subject of his own undoing, scorned at by prattling school girls and frowned upon by snuff taking old maids. O how I pity his lone condition! There was a time, perhaps, when boyhood's halcyon sun shine had tinged with its mellow light the young bud of hope, and he looked with ripening expectations to joys beyond, almost fancying in visions that ever and anon, in sportive glee, life's panoramic mirror pictured to his eyes, that he saw a cheering hearth stone, all his own, around which a sweet mother whose children called him father and loved him. But now, how changed! The stern realities of the present mock him to bitter reflections; and cursing that procrastinating indifference which has robbed him of every hope itself; he sits by a rayless fire the companion of gloom and the friend of non, a discontented being.  My Hearers, 3 times, thirdly. I had rather be a broken down stage horse, on as bad a road as the turnpike that runs through our pleasant and beautiful valley, with a drunken driver, and a coach full of passengers, rather than be one of you joyless, hope forsaken, women hated, buttonless, miserable mean devils, Have you a soul? forty five thousand of them would rattle in a mustard seed and dance polka's, and bowchukas, upon the point of a cambric needle,
That man among you who can't stump up courage enough to pass the interrogatory when occasion offers, is too mean to be the subject of a woman's mercy, and too insignificant for her justice to punish. He deserves to be tried by a jury of twelve disappointed old maids, and sentenced to be banished (clothed in a petticoat) from the land of free institutions, to live forever unpitied beneath the servile sufferings of scandalous subjections.  How obdurate must be the heart of him who, gazing into the stormy heaven of woman's eyes, or listening to the lute like sweetness of her voice, throbs not with the soft sympathy of love!  My Hearers, there's a Heaven in a gentle girls breast, fit as a temple for the indwelling of love and innocence, and could you but find a lodgment for your weary spirit within you'd scarcely exchange it for that where angels dwell.  I have stood by the side of her I loved, and as she leaned in tender confidence upon my arm, and turned upon me the spell like witchery of her blue eyes, I have felt a glow of pride in being loved by that dear one, which I would not exchange for thrones or empires!  Once more does the memory of my Katerine come back to me, as if she came to told me, she still loved me, most dearly and fondly, oh! how I long to twine my arms around her wasp-like waist, like de honey suckle climbs de crab apple tree. Julius Ceaser what times we had before day moved to sour krout stettle, day was times, indeed they was, but why lament, for times dat is past and gone, tink of de good times dat is to come.
Would you feel this glorious calm within, which, I doubt not, Heaven has given to man to feel as a foretaste of that intense sweetness which forms the "golden everlasting chain" of love which binds the spirits of the Blest? Open your heart, and the gentle Angel of Love will fold his gossamere wings and enter there.  Away with the contemptible excuse that no one would have you. You are not too old.  Try, try again.  To quote the language of one of our greatest Poets of the present age,  "There was never a goose so gray,  "But some day - soon or late,  "An honest gander came that way,  "And took her for his mate."  Although, my friends, the author from whom I have quoted these sensible lines speaks as referring to a goos, yet the same is applicable to a gander, and, if applicable to a gander, then, by a figure of speech, likewise to you.  Cheered then by this consoling truth, will you delay the happy hour? Remember that the ploughshare of time is gradually furrowing your manly faces over, and each departing year leaves upon you the imprint of its footsteps. Anxious old maids lean loving even now towards some of you, like a sick kitten to a hot brick, and some young ones I doubt not, would be darnation glad to get you. Up then, ye unsophisticated, superanuated; and supernumerated toadies you. Enter suit at once before your ugly countenances shall put in a plea in abatement of the actions.
File your declaration in Cupid's Court, fee Love as your attorney, engage one woman as a jury to try your case, and if she finds a verdict against you, appeal to another, but remember, my friends, that this is the only trial by jury in which issue is not arrived at until after the termination of the cause - that is by legitimate method.  My Hearers, 4 times fourthly, - and lastly, - In conclusion let me earnestly advise you with tears in my eyes by all manner of means to get you a rib, and when you are getting, get you a good one - one who knows a broomstick from a pan handle, and is acquainted with the duties of practical housekeeping. These whimsical, hysterical, coquettish little misses, who are half whalebone, and half grass skirts and bed cords, are not worth a sensible man's notice.  But a woman my friends, who properly understands the nature of the duties which are incumbent upon her, and feels a spirit to discharge  those duties is a blessing of incalculable value, and the sooner you obtain such an one, the nearer you are to heaven. With her life's current will run smoothly and sweetly on, unruffled and unrippled, and when finally its gentle tide shall ebb, it will flow so calmly into the great ocean of eternity, that scarce a bubble will mark its confluence.
A few more words and I have done. I am thankful to you my Hearers for your kind attention and I hope what I have said may do some good to those of dis audience who are on the brink of Bachelordom. get a duck of a wife by all means, and den you will live in joy and felicity all of your life. (dat is providing she does not scratch your eyes out.)  I would love to dwell longer on dis subject, but as it is soon yet, and I'm somewhat embarassed still in my cough, and fearing the dampness of the place might repair my institution, I find it necessary to disclose.  Therefore again, let me thank you for your attention. I have done.  More Anon  Delivered on the Banks of Penns Creek, above Hastleton at our Anual Pic-Nic by a pine knot light 1854. by Theo S. Christ

Popes. After staying here awhile we returned to Jenkins. on the road we passed a very ancient looking Episcopal Church, with a fine Cemetery attached. we also passed a brick church which is patronized by the poor white people and slaves. we then traveled on the broad road as it is called, and a lovely place it is to ride upon, very wide and shaded with live Oaks all the way. we had a dark on behind for footman, as all Gentlemen travel this way in the South. our party returned to Camp with plenty of beef. To night we bid good bye to 1861.

Viele, and Stephens, all under the Superintendence of Genl. T. W. Sherman. we heard the Canonnading all day. the Rebels were at the Ferry and our forces were at Beaufort. we wanted to and did cross and made the Rebels retreat. So says our Lieut. at the Signal Station. there was also two Gun boats of the new pattern.  2nd Day very warm. we heard more canonnading all day and this evening our expectations were gratified by the welcome news of our successful operations yesterday. Genl. Viele's Brigade having returned to Hilton Head and accomplished the object of their mission. the firing to day was from our Gun Boats, that were shelling the woods were the Rebels were concealed, having been chased there from the Ferry by our land forces. we captured one of their Guns, lost one man killed and 6 wounded from the Michigan 8th Regt. Vol's. also Maj. of the 8th Maine Regt. was wounded. he having volunteered his services to the 47th N. York regt. they have no Maj. at present. the Rebels lost over 140 killed and wounded not known, also took two of them prisoner, and one of those is mortally wounded. he says the same shell that struck him killed 12 men by his side. he also acknowledges their loss was very great. the object of this visit there was to destroy the work that we knew they were erecting at the Ferry, 7 miles above Beaufort, on the Main land. Our men say they could hear the Locomotives whistle and cars rattle on the Rail Road all night, bringing in re-inforcements from Charleston and Savannah. after taking and destroying this Fort and all its buildings, our men marched back to their quarters at Beaufort.

I have recd. no news for more than two weeks, and am almost inclined to become provoked about it. nothing new to day. all quiet.  5th Sunday. this morning it rained quite hard and was the first rainy day that we have had since our arrival in South Carolina. at 11 A.M. we recieved marching orders. much to our disappointment, as we had hoped when we moved again it would be to join the balance of our Regt. but no such good news. we were put on board the Cosmopolitan and remained there untill next morning, when we started for Skull Creek, and reached our destination in about an hours travel. and was landed at Seabrook landing about 3 1/2 miles from Hilton Head and across from Pinckney Island. this is a place for Vessels to take in coal and is a better landing than at Hilton Head. our half of the Regt. was then all cut up by sending a company to different Islands and Points to be guarded by them. we have one at Bradocks Point and so on. we are now the advance troops of Genl. Shermans Army. and the other half of our Regt. at Otter and Fenwick Island's, are the advance towards Charleston and only 30 miles from there. truly they have scattered the 45th to all sections.  6th Morning pleasant. we started from Bay Point at daylight and landed here an hour afterwards at Seabrook landing. we relieve the 55th Regt.

69  7th Day pleasant and warm. to day some of our men were out scouting and while out noticed the Rebel picketts on the opposite Island and talked with them, the distance being too great to understand what was said. it was in the neighborhood of Bluffton, we heard firing in that direction all day, but think they were practising with their Guns. we are on the advance towards Savannah. The Atlantic brought us a mail with news from home. it was hailed with delight and was very acceptable.  8th Day Cool. in the afternoon it rained a little. nothing new here to day. our men went out foraging and brought in some fresh meat. this morning six of us started for Braddocks Point where we have one Company stationed. we hitched on to the Ben Deford a Steamer, but she stuck so often along the road in the mud, that we gave it up and returned to quarters, and put it off untill another day. wrote to Sallie C.  9th Morning lovely and warm. after breakfast the Lt. Col. and myself started on horseback for Braddocks Point, on the way we visited Mrs. H. B. Stony's plantation also Mr Grahams. both pleasant homes, and show that the owners lived in good style. we travelled over several other plantations, and found the majority of them in excellent order, land good, and plenty of negroes. we reached Braddocks Point at noon. found our men all in good quarters and living very well and contented. they had but one sick man so after attending to his wants we went on top of the house, said to have been built by John C. Calhoun. here we were within 5 miles of Fort Pulaski and the State of Georgia, by the aid of my glass I could recognize the Guns, and flag staff on the fort. we also seen Tybee Island and our shipping there, also, Daufauskie, Bull, Song Islands and the Savannah River. this is a splendid place and our men enjoy themselves very well. after dinner we started from here for our quarters. we varied our course somewhat and came passed an Episcopalian and Baptist Church. at these places we noticed some very fine vaults for burying the dead, one in particular a Mr. Baynards. we rode 25 miles to day.

I found her sick with measles, and she was enciente and doing very well. I am annoyed very much by the negro's medicine, I generally give them when they need it, and go to see them if necessary. This is a very large and very good plantation, and everything looks as if the owner had considerable taste and enterprise, an uncommon thing I should judge in this Country, by what I have noticed at the different places I have been in the South.  12th Sunday, very warm and pleasant. to day I again visited Braddocks Point. the plantation belongs to Mr. Baynard. while here I recieved the joyful intelligence that some of our troops and a body of Engineers had succeeded in removing the hulks, sunk by the Rebels, in Newtons Cut, and that the channel was now clear to Savannah, so I expect in a few days, Genl. Sherman will send a fleet there. by this route they will pass by Fort Pulaski, and go through Skull Creek.  I had a delightful ride, was accompanied by Adjt. G. D. Smith. wrote to [Jennie] C. I also ate ripe tomatoes just pulled from the vines at dinner.  13th Day lovely and warm. to day we recieved a mail from Fortress Monroe, which brought news for all. this was the largest mail that has yet arrived at this Port. it was welcomely recieved. nothing new to day. last night we had an alarm here, it was brought about by our own men. they were out hunting cattle, when they found them and fired. which caused our sentinels to arouse us. we soon ascertained the Cause, and then went to bed. wrote to Sister Em.

There is considerable stir at Head Quarters, an advance will soon take place.

Day very warm. Visited Spanish Wells' Plantation to day. they were loading troops again to day at Seabrook, part of Genl. Viele's Brigade was shipped. Genl. Wright's Brigade left Hilton Head in Steamboats. there was several Gun Boats accompanied this expidition, and I suppose they were destined for the neighborhood of Savannah.  27th Very warm. heard Canonading all day, in the direction of Savannah. it was very heavy at times. Genl. Sherman left for the Scene of Action last night. My sick doing well. wrote to Nick. V.  28th Day very warm. heavy Canonading all day towards Savannah. it sounded splendidly, and would shake the windows in the house at our Head Quarters. they fired about every 4 seconds for hours at a time. Some very heavy and loud reports was heard here. it continued untill dark. there was intervals of a hour at a time, when it would begin again. in the night the Genl. McClellan returned to Hilton Head for more troops, because they had landed our Infantry, Artillery and Engineers North of Savannah and were now throwing up entrenchments, to protect
73  themselves. our Gun boats again done good execution. Seven Rebel Gun boats, undertook to run from Savannah to Fort Pulaski. they encountered our boats. So a battle took place among them. 4 Rebels boats retreated to Savannah, the other three made for the Fort. 2 succeeded in getting past, and 1 was completely destroyed by our boats. this is the report I have heard. this afternoon I was hastily summoned to Seabrook, as one of our men had been accidentally shot in the leg, by his comrade. the ball entered at the insertion of the Gastrocnemii Muscle and was lodged in the Popliteal Space. After probing the wound I discovered the ball and then cut down upon it and removed it with but little trouble. We recieved a large mail to day. Steamer Genl. Scott broke in two.  29th Day very warm and pleasant. Considerable firing heard all day in the direction of Savannah. it is certain that our forces are between Savannah and Fort Pulaski, which will cut off the supplies to the Fort. they are scarce of wood and water there, but have plenty of provisions.  30th Very warm. to day the air is flying full of embers, and it is very smoky. it comes from the direction of (or rather below) Savannah. we suppose the woods have been fired on the main land. Considerable firing heard again to day. as yet have recieved no news from that direction. to night the whole heavens are illuminated from a large fire a great distance off, in the direction where the embers and smoke came from to day.  There is a change some way taken place among the Rebels. I judge so because the usual Signal in the direction of Bluffton is not seen to night. this Signal we have seen every evening since we are here untill to night. it was a very bright light and would remain up for hours. they would then draw it to the ground. we supposed here that it was a small balloon. I laughed very heartily to night at a negro man Stephen, giving us a full description of the Rebels retreating from Hilton Head, when our forces landed there. it was very amusing indeed.
74  31st Day windy and pleasant. A number of us went to Braddocks Point early this morning, expecting to see an engagement between our Gun boats and those of the Rebels. alas, we were disappointed, the latter was not to be seen. we learned the Cause of last nights fire, it was the woods on the lower part of this Island. no news to day, and no firing. traded horses, mine gave out.

Case of obstruction of the bowels still the same, except their is very little pain.

K. lost their way, and crossed Co. H.'s path and stopped at the house where the Rebels were known to assemble. Capt. S. halted them, but they say they did not hear the word, and as two of Capts. Rambo's men ran they supposed they were Rebels. So Capt. S' men (25 in number) fired and hit ten. Capt. R. returned the fire and hit one man in Co. H. it is a melancholy affair, and under the Circumstances no one can be blamed. they done what they had been ordered to do. it happened with our men at Otter Island, S.C. the bodies were sent home.  16th Sunday.

England and France are becoming more reconciled to our blockades and actions, and begin to see that we are in earnest, and if necessary will give her a show of our abilities as regards good fighting etc. one at a time is all we ask, and all shall be accommodated. wrote to Jennie Cameron  19th Day pleasant and quite warm. nothing of any importance occurred to day along this line of operations. wrote to D.

I took the Splints off of Wm. Orner's Arm and find the fractured bones firmly united and perfectly natural.  thus have I succeeded in saving an arm after being (the bone) shattered to pieces with a musket ball, six weeks ago, causing a Compound Fracture of the Humerus. I am proud of this Surgical Operation, and it has convinced me that Conservative Surgery, will answer the purpose sometimes, notwithstanding the condemnation of it, by most Authors on Surgery. This Island has been examined very closely to day. trying to capture some Rebel spies that has been reported to have been on it, making observations etc. it is rumored that an attack will be made on this Island very soon. I do not credit the report. have not learned of the Capture of the spies as yet, if here, they will be taken.  23rd Sunday, day pleasant. recd. a large mail, and as usual it brought us more good news. the Capture of Newbern, N.C. and of more victories in the West.

Sent Draft to Mrs. D.S. Kremer for Daniel S. Kremer for $200.00 this day.
85  10th Morning beautiful, at 8 A.M. Our Batteries on Tybee Island commenced bombarding Fort Pulaski. I went over to Jenkins Island and with the aid of a good glass I watched the firing from both sides for over an hour. both parties worked faithfully, the shells from our Guns would burst immediately over the Fort, while most of the enemies fell short. I then went to Seabrook to see the sick and afflicted. while there, I removed a Steatomatous Tumor from Lieut. Irvin's head of 10 years standing. I made a nice operation of it. I then extracted a shot from a Nego's tongue, that had been in for 5 months. he was shot through the cheek by his master while making his escape from him to this Island. I then returned home. in the evening I went to Braddocks Point, to witness the firing on the Fort, but it had ceased before I reached there, it being after night. through the night there was several shots fired. I have two Small Pox patients on hand.  11th morning again lovely. at daylight the firing commenced again from our Guns on the Fort. I went down to the beach and was then within 3 miles of the scene of operations. I watched the performance untill 11 A.M. during this time the Fort caught fire once, but was soon quelled. our shot struck the Fort time and again and always at the same place. I could see the dust flying every shot. while our shells would burst in and over the Fort, it was a beautiful picture. still I grew tired of it. I never seen a more magnificent sight. I then went up to the Alligator pond and there seen three of these ugliest of Animals, (Alligators) lying out in the sun. none of them was less than 8 feet in length and one must have been ten feet. I shot at one with my pistol and hit him on the head, and such a time as he had to get into the water was really laughable. I then took my dinner and left for head quarters. this was at 2 P.M. and the battle still raged furiously at the Fort. our men fired as many as 99 guns in 15 minutes. Our Mortars made the whole earth ring. Discharged 8 men from Service to day.
86  12th Day pleasant, but windy. yesterday I had left Braddocks but a few minutes, when the Rebels in Fort Pulaski hauled down their flag and ceased firing. our guns continued firing a short time but having no reply, was convinced that they wished to surrender the Fort. a boat went over well loaded with troops and took the Rebels prisoners, 386 in all officers and men. upon examination, the Fort was found completely damaged inside, and at the corner where I had noticed the dust flying yesterday, there was two holes knocked in large enough to drive a horse and wagon through. the shells from the Fort done little or no damage to our men on Tybee Island. they killed but one man for us, and none wounded. we wounded three of their men seriously, but killed none. it is really wonderful that there was so little damage done to the men on both sides. this morning the Stars and Stripes were hoisted on the old Fort, never again to be taken down I hope, as long as Pulaski stands. we have now free access to the mouth of the Savannah River. a short time ago the Citizens of Savannah offered $100,000 to any one for the Garrison of this Fort. I suppose they will not give the reward to us Yankees. while this bombardment was going on, Com. Tatnall with his Mosquito Fleet made several attempts to get to the Fort, but was as often driven back by our batteries on Bird and Jones Islands. to day heavy firing was heard in the direction of these batteries. to morrow the prisoners will be sent North. we recd. a mail to day. bringing papers up to the 7th inst. wrote to Kremer and Sister. Small Pox patients doing well.  13th Sunday. Day stormy. went to Hilton Head, and seen a number of the captured prisoners of the Fort. they are a rough looking sett of men, and principally foreigners. no two are dressed alike. it appears each one wore what he pleased. all appeared in
87  good spirits, and say our men fought well and hard, and acknowledged that they were badly whipped. they say they would never have surrendered untill the Fort would be knocked down, but they seen we were doing that, and in a half hours more time, the magazine would have blown up and them with it. so they thought best to surrender. they will all be sent North to morrow as prisoners of war. I had the pleasure of meeting my old friend Col. J. W. Shaffer of Genl. Hunters Staff. he is Chief Quarter Master of this division. he was glad to see me. wrote to Emilie, and to W. H. Chamberlin.  14th Day unpleasant with heavy showers. nothing new transpired to day. Another Steamer came in to day, bringing us more good news from the West. Genls. Buell and Grant have had a great battle and have came off victorious. the fight took place between Pittsburg and Corinth in Miss. the loss is great on both sides, supposed to be 18000, killed, wounded and missing on our side, and 30,000 killed, wounded and Prisoners on the Rebel side. our Com. Foote has also captured Island No. 10, without any loss of life. Genl. McClellan is advancing on Yorktown Virginia. thus the ball is proudly rolling on, and our glorious banner is floating again on the breeze. Wrote to Annie Linn  15th Rained very hard in the morning, Afternoon pleasant. rode down to Hilton Head. visited Capt. Campbell the Provost Marshal, and seen the balance of the prisoners from Fort Pulaski, including all the Officers. I was introduced and conversed with Col. Omstead, who was in Command there, also to Doctors McFarlan and Lungrene. I was very much pleased with them, they were quite talkative, but felt very sore, when anything was said about their cause. of course we talked but little on that subject. they appeared surprised to learn that so few of us were Abolitionists, they understood we were all of that school. I also seen their Chaplin, who was a Catholic Priest.
88  16th Day pleasant, but very warm. nothing of note occurred along the line of our Picket. Stewart Chronister of Co.

Hunter, to have all able bodied Negro's capable of bearing fire-arms to report at Hilton Head to morrow forenoon. I suppose to arrange them in Military discipline, in order to use them in Forts and other places. I despise such an arrangement, and think it un-called for, and should not be recognized by Northern Troops.  Neither will it be, I feel confident it is wrong. The following is a true copy of said Order:  Head Quarters: Department of the South.  Hilton Head, South Carolina, May 9, 1862.  General Orders  No. 11.  The three States of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, comprising the Military Department of the South, having deliberately declared,
92  themselves no longer under the protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against said United States, it became a Military necessity to declare Martial Law. This was accordingly done of the 25th of April, 1862. Slavery and Martial Law, in a free country, are altogether incompatible; the persons in these three States, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, heretofore held as slaves, are therefore declared forever free.  David Hunter,  Major General  Commanding.  (Official.)  This was done by one man, in a few moments, while Congress has spent much time and millions of money to do th same thing for the past 60 years. how the like should have been disposed of by one person in so short a time, is almost miraculous. however I hope and pray the President will discountenance it, and reprimand the person who dared assume so much responsibility.  12th Day very warm and sultry. According to yesterdays Orders, the Negro's in our command were gathered here at our Head Quarters, and after being drawn up in line, the word forward march was given, they were taken to the Head under the care of a guard. there was 121 in all, many were proud of it, others not understanding the movement. was very much alarmed as they heard they were to be taken to Cuba and sold. they are now in charge of Terrells Engineer Corps, and will be uniformed and drilled as soldiers. for what purpose I am unable to say. Our men all feel highly insulted at this arrangement and protest against everything of the kind. wrote to Col. Welsh and Dr. Potter.  13th Day warm. all quiet along our line of Picket. am not feeling very well. recd. a number of papers from Hon. E. Slifer, Sec. of State. wrote to D. S. Kremer, B. and M.

To day a Steamboat came to the Head from Charleston, S.C. with a crew of 5 Negro's and their families. quite a good boat with 8 guns on. they manage it in the following way. when their officers left the Boat for Charleston, they told the crew to run down the Harbor and Anchor.  the darks held a meeting and concluded they would like to see the Star and Stripes once more. the zengineer said, (who was a black and a Pilot,) he would show it to them if they would do as he ordered. all agreed. they went and brought their families on board, then steamed by the Fort, (Sumter) and gave the usual signal three whistles, then made for our blockading squadron, hoisted the white flag, gave themselves up to our fleet. when an officer went on board and brought Boat and Crew to this place. they went to the flag ship Com. DuPont's, when an Officer asked who was Commander of that vessel, the Pilot, a negro, stepped up and said I am de boss of her Sir, and fatched her here safely. the Commodore recommends $500 to be given to the Pilot, and $1500 more to be divided among the Crew, as prize money. numerous rumors are afloat here as to the surrendering of different places, but no confidence is placed in them. This negro crew brought a Charleston paper with them, which says Norfolk is evacuated and Navy Yard burned. also that the Merrimac is sunk, all of which is good news to us.  15th Day cool and very pleasant. Co. B of the 76th Regt. P.V. now at Seabrook, was placed under my Medical Charge. I visited them to day.  found several sick and prescribed for them. I also visited as an act of humanity a poor Negro, with Small Pox, on the Elliott Plantation and administered to his wants. he had been chained in the woods by some persons.

While on the Island we were in sight of the Rebels all the time on the Main Land. this is our advance picket station.

She was laying her eggs in the sand and had deposited there 144 eggs, and was returning to the water when they killed her. She weighed over 800 pounds.

I should have added 1000 more small eggs, that were still in the bag that was just being brought forth. in all there was over 2000 eggs in one Turtle.
96  31st Day very pleasant. I see by the late papers that the course pursued by Maj. Genl. David Hunter, in reference to his freeing all the slaves forever in this district, according to order No. 11, is disapproved by the President of the U.S. also by the Majority of Citizens. this is right and just what I expected of all reasonable men. the time may come when it will be done. that time is not here yet.  To day I recieved by Adams Express Co. a very handsome present, from Daniel A. Fisher of New York, a Government Cotton Agent, who lay sick here with Typhoid Fever for six weeks and under my charge.

Wrights delay, was owing to the swamps he encountered on his march, we heard that Col. B.C. Christ of the 50th Pa. Vol's. was attacked to day at Port Royal Ferry and had his pickets driven in and that Beaufort S.C. was in danger.  the Col. is in Command there and has no troops but his own Regiment. there was some troops sent to him and a few Gun-boats. the Gideonites were all sent here, from there, for protection, as well as a great number of Contra-bands. we heard of a mail arriving this evening, bringing good news from all quarters, from our Armies. Corinth is evacuated and McClellan is fighting them sucessfully at Richmond. Fremont is at Strasburg Virginia, in hot pursuit of "Stonewall" Jackson, who had driven Genl. Banks, back to Harpers Ferry, and threatened Baltimore, but he was foiled in that. Jackson had 15000 men, and Banks had but 4000. his retreat was well managed.  Banks has gone forward again with re-inforcements, and is retracing his steps and will soon reach his old post at Strasburg.  8th Sunday. heavy showers to day. Col. Christ has been re-inforced at Beaufort and there is now no danger. recieved our mail. Genl.

Stevens attacked a Fort on James Island, and met with a heavy loss on his side, that of the Rebels is unknown. Stevens had but few men and was compelled to retreat. he was to have been re-inforced from Genl. Wright, but a swamp was between them and it was impossible for Wright to render him assistance, had this been done, we would have gained a victory. Our six Companies was with Wright and therefore was not in the fight, which took place on Monday last. our loss in Killed, wounded and missing is supposed to be 679. one of our men was so daring as to enter the Fort, catch a Rebel by the hair on his head and dragged him into our Camp a prisoner.

We also heard to day that Genl. Benham was placed under arrest, for dis-obeying orders at Stono Inlet. he was ordered not to advance upon James Island at the time he did, but he it appears did advance, and this explains why Genl's.

To days paper says that Genl. Seigel entrapped 2000 Rebels, and took them prisoners, near Culpeper C.H. Genl's. McClellan and Burnsides passed here to day from the Landing. four heavy Batteries passed to day.  25th Day very pleasant. visited Acquia Cree. I found there several friends belonging to different Regiments. I noticed the Harbor lying full of Transports. Some 150, all landed with Government supplies. I then took the train for Fredericksburg.  26th Very warm. this morning I called at Burnsides Head Quarters and had a talk with W.H. Church, Medical Director of this Army Corps. I then took a stroll through Fredericksburg, was not favorably impressed with the place. there is a few very fine residences, and any number of very old and inferior buildings. the place is situated on the Banks of the Rappahanock River, is very uneven and irregularly laid out. Streets and pavement very poor. I returned to Camp in the Afternoon very tired.
115  27th Day very warm and sultry. Visited our detachment at Potomac Bridge. Genl. Sumner's Division passed here to day, in which was Genl. Thomas F. Meagher's Corps. heavy canonading heard all day.  28th Very warm. Last night we received word that Popes Army was retreating, and Stonewall Jackson was within 16 miles of Washington. this we did not believe. Shortly afterwards Sumner's Division returned from Fredericksburg. this we could not understand, untill later, we learned they were to report at Alexandria, a mistake had been made in some way. To day the news is that Col. Fitzhugh Lee was committing depredations on our picket along the R. Road near Manassas. Canonading is still going on.  29th Day very warm and sultry. Visited the Landing. Fredericksburg is being evacuated by our Union Citizens. the Rebels are advancing on the place. Burnsides is still at his Head Quarters at Falmouth, and is ready to give them a warm reception if they attempt to cross the Rappahanock River. we are all expecting a raid on our lines, and will fight them hard, every man is well provided for etc. I had the pleasure to day, of making the acquaintance of Capt. Morris of our Navy, late of the ill-fated Cumberland, and now Commanding a Squadron of Gun-Boats. heavy canonading heard all day. wrote to Bro. and Sister Kremer.  30th Very pleasant. the report of yesterday was without foundation, and occurred in this way. the Pickets were being releived by a new sett. Some Negro's see it, and gave the alarm that the enemy were advancing. in a short time afterwards, re-connoitering parties was sent out, for miles around, and returned with the above information. all is quiet in this section of country to day. We received good news from the vicinity of Manassas. McClellan, Pope, Banks, Seigel and McDowell are having warm work, with Jackson's forces, but are surrounding them, and a heavy engagement is expected. Our Hospital and Regiment, received a fine treat from the Ladies of Lancaster County, Vegetables etc.
116  31st Day very cool. this was a busy day for our men, removing government stores, property etc from Fredericksburg and Falmouth. everything of any value was sent to Aquia Creek, and put on transports for Alexandria, Vir. at dusk all things being removed except some Hay and damaged stores. the buildings was sett on fire and destroyed. then the wire bridge across the Rappahannock was blown up. nothing remained of our forces but a few of Burnsides Rickett Guard. the General and Staff soon after left and took their Boat the Alice Price as their Head Quarters again. the whole affair was well managed and all sent off in good order. nevertheless we were constantly expecting an attack upon the whole line. to day I received orders to pack up my Hospital supplies etc and be ready to move at a moments notice.  It rained and stormed all day very hard. was mustered for pay. The news from our Army in the vicinity of Manassas is very encouraging. a heavy battle was fought.
117  September, 1862.  1st Day very unpleasant, with a tremendous storm and rain. we have been re-inforced to day with a battery of Artillery, Cavalry, and two Regiments of infantry. received orders to send all my sick in Hospital and those unfit for duty, to Genl. Hospital, at Alexandria. I done so and sent two nurses with them, 53 in all. heard no canonading since Saturday. we still expect an attack on us here. we are now drawn up in line of battle, and will contest the ground.  2nd Day very cool. we have been busy all day moving stores and government property, from the different stations along the Rail road, and have all away and at the landing except our own Regimental property. a number of our men are out now blockading the roads, to prevent a sudden surprise on us here. burned Potomac Creek Bridge.  3rd Day warm and pleasant. men are still kept busy blockading the roads, and we are shipping stores as fast as we can. the object is to evacuate this place. Our Picketts have all been drawn in to Brooks Station. The Rebels are in Fredericksburg in force.  4th Still warm and pleasant. this morning we all moved to Aquia Creek. the rest of the troops are nearly all gone, we bringing up the rear. burnt the bridge over Oakeekee Creek.  5th Very warm. Troops all gone except our own Regiment. While some of our men, were out on Pickett to day, they foolishly left their posts without Arms, and 3 of the 5 were taken prisoners. the other 2 reached Camp in safety. we pursued the Captors a few miles, but they being Cavalry and ourselves Infantry, we had to leave them to their fate. Rebels are still coming in to Fredericksburg.
118  6th Very warm. at noon to day we embarked on the Steamers Express and Niagara for Washington City. before leaving we had orders to burn the buildings, Dock, Cars etc. which we done effectually, also a number of government Stores, of but little value, nearly all damaged. we saved all the Locomotives and good cars, put them all on transports and sent them elsewhere for further use. while the conflagration was at its height, the Steamboat bells and whistles made an unearthly noise. it was really very exciting. we left Aquia Creek, at 1 P.M. and bid farewell to our old home.  As we went gliding along, I noticed a great number of shad fisheries, near Mt. Vernon, on both sides of the River, also many pleasant residences. the Scenery along the Potomac is beautiful is beautiful and very romantic. at 4 P.M. we passed Mount Vernon, where rests the remains of the immortal Washington. all is quiet there, he sleeps his last sleep - "Peace to his Ashes." his country is now all excitement, and our Capital is again threatened to be destroyed by Traitors and Rebels. About one mile above is Fort Washington, a very substantial structure. from here we can see the City of Washington. the dome of the Capital is plainly seen with the naked eye, distance about 20 miles. the River is lying full of all manner of transports, the like I have never witnessed before. we are nearing Alexandria, and as we pass, we are saluted by thousands of our fellow soldiers, Steamboat whistles and bells. at dusk we reached the wharf at 6th Street Washington. after landing our troops and unloading our stores we went into Camp for the night.  I was compelled to leave my Horse Dixie
119  7th Sunday, day pleasant. at early dawn we moved our men up 7th St. to cook rations etc. preparatory to a march. I find the citizens here are not fearful of the enemy approaching. McClellan has charge of all the fortifications around the City. Pope is removed from his command, and sent West. Genl's. Burnside, Banks, Hooker, Sumner and Siegel, have sole control of the field, but all under McClellan. the enemy are now threatening to cross into Maryland in force.evening, the enemy are across and are now in Frederick, Md. 5000 strong, but have been repulsed by Genl. Wool. we left Washington, at 3 P.M. and marched 12 miles and then halted for the night. our baggage train failed to reach us, so we done without supper and shelter. took "terra firma," for it and slept sweetly untill daylight.  8th Very warm and sultry. marched but a few miles to day. went into Camp beyond Leesboro, where we again entered our old 9th Corps de Armee, commanded by Genl. Jesse Reno, placed in Genl. O. Wilcox's, 1st Division, and into Col. Welsh's, Brigade (the 2nd) consisting of the 45th and 100th P.V. and 46th N.Y. and all under Burnsides.  9th Very warm. I am feeling very sick from a billous attack. I was compelled to take the Ambulance the last two miles of the march. passed through Mechanicsville and Brookeville, both small places. encamped beyond the latter place. we are now 28 miles from Baltimore and about the same from Frederick.  10th Day cool, am no better to day. have suffered intense pain in my head. totally unable to be up and about Camp. I therefore keep quiet and enjoy a bed made of rails. took an Emetic at night which operated very severly. I was advised by many of the Officers to go to some house, and remain untill well, and then follow the Regiment. I would not do it, neither will I do so, unless compelled by my illness, remained in camp.
120  11th Morning cloudy. our whole force started on the march at 6 A.M. I took the Ambulance, still feeling miserable. we are marching towards Frederick, passed through Bladensville and Damascus, both small towns. the farms through this section of country are very good and apparently productive, fruit is very plenty. it is very hilly. roads pretty good. encamped for the night at Kemptown. the Rebel Cavalry pickett had been here to day. our Cavalry routed them, and brought in a few as Prisoners. we are now 14 miles from Frederick. rained at night.  12th Morning unpleasant with rain. Marched at daylight. I took at a foot again, feeling much better. crossed the Baltimore and Ohio R. Road at Monrovia, where we were greeted with cheers and Union flags flying. a piece beyond we passed through New Market, quite a large and beautiful place, looks more like a Town than any we have seen for some time. there is considerable weather here, and the country around is beautiful. some magnificent country seats and excellent farms. we were told that Genl. Lee, was here yesterday, but left again for Frederick. many complained that the Rebels had taken everything from them. entered Frederick at dusk, and drove out the Rebel force, under command of Generals Lee, Jackson, Ewell, Hill and others. report says both Lee and Ewell are wounded, and both are being hauled in Ambulances. One of our shells to day fell among some Rebels at a battery, and killed and wounded 20 of their men. our advance has driven them into and through Frederick, and pursued them several miles. Our Division encamped within 2 miles of Frederick. I went to a Union farmers and had a cup of tea and toast, and was fortunate enough to secure a bed, which was the first I had slept in for 10 months.
121  13th Day very pleasant. our advance was fighting all day, principally Artillery. we lost but few men. Rebels lost heavily in Killed, wounded and prisoners. we left our Camp at 5 P.M. marched through Frederick, which always has been a very strong union place. it is quite a large city, very well built and quite a beautiful town. Streets and side walks are all paved. the Ladies cheered us quite heartily as we passed through the Streets. we marched on the Hagerstown turnpike, passed through Glennville and encamped near Middletown, 10 miles from our last encampment.  14th Sunday. this morning I was visited by Lewisburg friends, which was quite a treat. heavy canonading heard at daylight. our advance was fighting all morning. after breakfast we were again on the March. passed through Middletown which is quite a neat little place, and halted for a short time beyond. at 2 P.M. our Division was ordered forward. we went up a lane, the roughest I ever travelled, when the shells came over our heads in great numbers, and many exploded very close to us. we then went into the main road on the extreme left of the Turnpike, where Genl. Sumner's Corps. was engaging the enemy. we were not here long however, when we were ordered forward. here we lay but a short time, when an order came from McClellan, that a Battery in our front must be silenced at all hazzards. Genl. Wilcox ordered our Brigade to do it, and our COlonel Welsh, Acting Brigadier, ordered our own Regt. to advance first. we advanced to the brow of a hill, where all superfluous baggage was thrown off, and the Reg't. went into the cornfield and quietly crawled to near the top of Blue Ridge, then sent out two Companies as skirmishers, A. and B. they were not there long untill they seen the Rebels jumping over the fences, when our boys commenced firing. then our
122  Regiment advanced to support our skirmishers. this brought on a regular engagement. our noble 45th fought with the bravery and skill of Veteran Soldiers, stormed their battery and put the Rebels to flight, where they had thousands against our hundreds. the balance of our Brigade came in as a reserve, and was soon engaged. we fought about 2 1/2 hours. everything in the shape of Ammunition was entirely exhausted. all this time I was busily engaged with my 2 Assistants, caring for the wounded, finding our Hospital too much exposed to the fight. I moved down the hill about 300 yards, where I established my Hospital, and soon I had my hands full, as our brave boys were carried to me by the dozen. before moving from my first position, my life was in great danger. one place that I had been just a few moments before, a shell struck and exploded, throwing the dirt all over me 50 yards off. at another time the grape and canister rolled by me, as if some one was sending them towards me by the shovel full. often while dressing the wounded at the brow of the hill, my men would say Doctor, do sit down and work, you will get killed, while here the minnie balls was humming around me with that hateful hist, they always make, like bees around the hive when disturbed. at dusk our Brigade was relieved by fresh troops, who pursued the enemy, from the ground our men had gained. I worked hard all afternoon and night. Our Regiment suffered severly. we lost 24 killed on the field, and 112 wounded, many mortaly. after night I Amputated Capt. Groves leg. it was a compound comminuted fracture of both bones, from a solid shot. Genl. Reno, commander of our Corps was wounded seriously, close by me, and died soon afterwards. Our wagons have again failed to get up, and we are nearly starved. name of this battle is South Mountain. My beloved and esteemed
123  friend Lieut. G. D. Smith, of Wellsboro, Tioga Co. Pa. was killed. at the time he was acting A. Adjt. Genl. to Col. Welsh, and had just delivered his message to cease firing, when a ball penetrated the left Axilla, and severed the Aorta, and he died without a struggle almost instantly. "Peace to his Ashes." he was a christian and a hero. for 8 long months on the Sandy Islands of South Carolina, we were as brothers, slept together, messed together, and agreed at all times, we just suited each other. happy and pleasant was our associations. when I looked upon his corpus, tears flowed freely from my eyes, and I wept, as if he had been a brother.  15th Morning lovely. I worked hard all night with the wounded, and up to 12 M. when they were all cared for, and I commenced sending them off to the Genl. Hospital in Ambulances. during the Night and forenoon we performed a great many operations of all kinds. my supplies were nearly exhausted. after I had my work about completed, I visited our killed and wounded, and found there had 5 died during the night of their wounds. here lay two Lieutenants, Smith and Cole, and 27 Privates, all in one now, waiting for their Grave to be finished that were being prepared for their final resting place, while around this mournful and sad place, could be seen the friends of the slain, in small groups, engraving as best they could the names of our Comrades on boards, for tombstones. each had a grave and each was marked. after all was buried, there was a fence placed around the whole of them. I turned away, with a sad heart, trusting to meet them again, where war and bloodshed never comes. they died for their Country's honor. Oh! what a monument is theirs. "Peace to their Ashes." After quilting this place, I visited the battle field, where our Noble boys was slain, and where our brave band stormed the battery, and here was truly a horrible sight to behold. the Rebel dead and wounded lay around in piles or heaps. near the stone
124  fences that they had to protect them. they suffered severely, and lost about 4 to our one. Some of their wounds was most frightful ones. we cared for their wounded, and while dressing some of their wounds, they acknowledged their loss as being very heavy, and insisted that the fire from our Regt. (45th P.V.) was from sharp. shooters, and they said it made them retreat. they could not stand such warm work as our boys gave them. I done the same for them as I did for our own wounded. they lost many of their Officers. Genl's. Burnsides and Wilcox, both complimented our Regt. in person, and said we turned the tide of battle in our favor that day, and that the Regiment had covered themselves with honor and glory. After the burying of our dead was finished we again started on the March, went by a few miles, when we halted for several hours, to rest, which was much needed by all of us. we had worked hard and industriously, and for my own part had but little to eat. wagons still behind somewhere. I was nearly exhausted, I left one Assistant back to see to our wounded in Hospital.  16th This morning at 1 A.M. we started again for the scene of Action where we reached at 4 A.M. and was halted on the road leading to Sharpsburg. there was hard fighting all day, principally an Artillery fight, supported by our Infantry in the advance. we repulsed the enemy at several points, took a number of their Guns, and many Prisoners. fight continued all day and untill after night. we were ordered under Arms several times to day and night. re-inforcements are coming in rapidly. Our Ambulances came up to day wrote to Sister Kremer  17th Morning lovely. canonading commenced at an early hour this morning. our Division was ordered to be in readiness to act as a Reserve. it only lasted however untill after dinner, when they were ordered to cross the Bridge over Antietam Creek.
125  they went over under a most galling fire of Grape and canister from the Rebel batteries on the surrounding hills. our Regiment was then sent out as skirmishers, through a corn field towards Sharpsburg. they actually entered this town the first of our troops, and captured 8 Prisoners, one was Capt. Twiggs, Nephew of Genl. Twiggs the Traitor, and brought them back and gave them up as prisoners of war. they could have done more there, but was ordered back by the Commanding General. Burnsides seen them go, and remarked that, that Regiment would be taken prisoners. Genl. Wilcox said no they would not, that it was the 45th P.V. Burnsides then said, if any Regt. can ever get away safely that one can. Our Regt. again fought bravely, and was supposed at one time, to have been cut all to pieces, from the danger that they were in, being under the enemies fire of Grape, Canister and Shell for over three hours, but fortunately and remarkable indeed, we lost but one man killed and 36 wounded. fighting continued untill after night, when both Armies quit, and commenced burying the dead and carrying off the wounded. I was again employed all day with the wounded of other Regiments, and at night with our own. most of our men was dangerously wounded. we again performed quite a number of Amputations. Name of this battle is Antietam Creek, or battle near Sharpsburg. our Regt. remained on the battle field. One of my nurses captured me a fine Horse.  18th Day cloudy with heavy rains. very little fighting done to day. the enemy commenced retreating last night. I finished my wounded by 5 P.M. to day, and sent them nearly all to Hospitals. I again worked all night, with but little to eat. I hope we will now have some rest. it is the hardest work I ever done. I also dressed the wounds of friends and others in the 48th and 51st P.V. at dusk our Regiment was relieved by fresh troops. the re-crossed
126  the Antietam Creek, and cooked rations. I joined the Regiment after dark, where I enjoyed a fine nights rest, on the damp ground. it is said Generals Lee and Jackson commanded the Rebel forces here.  19th Day pleasant and very warm. received marching orders at 8 A.M. we forded Antietam Creek, passed over the battle ground, which still presents a horrible appearance. the Rebel dead are still unburied. also many dead horses are seen lying around. Guns, Cartridges and boxes, etc. are very plenty. we marched through Sharpsburg, which is only a small town, and pretty well destroyed. we then turned towards the Potomac, and went into Camp early in the evening within two miles of the Potomac. the Rebels are still crossing into Virginia. our Artillery are playing into them all day. why Genl. McClellan does not follow up their retreat, I cannot understand. here is the  whole Army lying idle, and anxious to cut off their retreat, but lying idle. wrote to Kremer and Sister  20th Day pleasant. Our Division remained in camp all day. there was no advance of our Army Corps. (9th). Our Artillery are still engaging the retreating enemy all day. Our advance made a reconnoisance on the other side of the Potomac, captured a six gun battery, and brought it over safely. the right wing of our Army are in pursuit of the enemy, and have taken a number of prisoners. Our men made good use of their spare time, by washing their bodies and clothing.  21st Sunday. no movement of troops to day.
