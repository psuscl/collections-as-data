[4-5]   Camp near Falmouth Va January 11th 1863 -----   This little book was sent to me by my brother U.[?] L. Pickel - after I have been four months in the U.S - Service as a private in co. G[?] Capt. Warren L. Young - and in it I propose to keep a memorandum of events as they pass under my notice in the hope that they be of interest for future reference. I must gather the events of the past - from the time we left home from memory and for much of the dates I am indebted to my friend and fellow soldier James Davis--------   I enlisted as a volunteer in Co. G. Scott Legion 68th P.A. on the 13th day of August 1862 without any experience in military life - our Head Quarters being in Chestnut Street below 6th Philadelphia the encampment being at Frankford I remained in the city at home until[?] thursday the 28th of August when I went to camp
[6-7]  And Spent my first night under canvas--  Friday 29th Spent the day looking round campu and getting acquainted with some of the boys - in the evening participated in my first dress parade-- Saturday 30th went on guard, as per order and Spent 24 hours in that capacity, which brings us to Sunday morning the 31st at 9 O’clock -- took a good wash and in company with James Davis took a walk to the arsenal and [?] the grounds -- Saw the troops there go through their regular sunday morning inspection of arms[?] and equipments - returned to camp and found my Brother U.L. there to see me - he brought me some things from home him and I took a walk through Frankford - took dinner at a Hotel relished it well - have eat but one dinner at
[8-9]  a table since (over 4 mo) we returned to camp and towards evening my old and valued friend Mr. John T. Hoopes came out and I went with him + my Brother into the city - left my Brother at his home 6th + Girard Avenue - parted with Hoopes at 10th + Poplar st. and have not seen him since -- Went home + found my little family all well and glad to see - begin to realize the job I had before me in parting with my family. Spent a pleasant night not thinking it would be the last one at home which it proved to be   Monday Sept 1st 1862 was up early. Eat a heavy breakfast and went out to say good bye to some intimate friends -- Stoped to see my old friend John She[?] he gave me some tobacco + other little things
[10-11]  which he thought might be of service to me- there was a general talk that we were ordered to moove that day. I returned home and arranged to start out to camp again. I bid my family goodbye, saying that I would see them again which I fully expected to do. But when I got to camp I found preperations being made to moove and I have not saw my family since-  We left Frankford at 3 O’Clock, rode to 5th and 6th street R. R. and marched from there to the citizens refreshment saloon where we partook of a good supper - it was now dark and raining very hard - lingered here about an hour and then marched to the baltimore depot when we took the cars for Washington starting about ½ past 11 O’clock at night - (Raining hard)
[12-13]  Previous to our going to the depot and while at the saloon my brothers joined me and presented me with a gun blanket which I have found of much service also a portfolio and some writing materials together with a colt revolver which I sent home again after finding it of little use to me- My brother left me in the cars - at daylight Tuesday morning we found ourselves crossing the Susquehanna river arrived in Baltimore and partook in refreshments at the soldiers saloon - our journey from here to Washington tedious- stopped three horses on the road at anapolis Junction to allow trains running North to pass - finally reached washington almost 10 0’clock at night and after again partaking of some refreshments
[14-15]  at the dirtiest place I ever saw to eat in - it is called the soldiers retreat - we lay down in rows in a long frame barrack and spent the ballance of the night - in the morning we again visited the retreat and after some confusion + delay incident to our finding our baggage and getting into line we marched through the city and crossing the Long Bridge into Virginia was soon quartered in an old apple orchard on Arlington Heights overlooking the city - This brings us to Wednesday sept. 3rd and is noted entirely from memory I will now merely note the dates of our mooves from place to place of to present time - on the evening of the 5th we mooved to Fort Lyons - marched 5 or 6 miles - warm night + got very tierd
[16-17]  September  On the 10th we mooved again and encamped at Fair Fox Seminary - a beautiful place - occupied as a hospital - On the 12th we had another warm days march and found ourselves Angrily encamped, in the evening in a peach orchard in the vicinity of our first stopping place on the Heights - it might be here remarked that on the 10th which at the     September  Seminary we received our warrants for fifty dollars bounty given by the city of Philadelphia for recruits - sent it home safely and retained $2.50 for my own little wants 14th was detailed for fatigue duty - 3 companys - A-B- G which was our first lesson with pick and shovel on entrenchments 15th-- mooved again to another position in the same neighborhood
[18-19]  September  Located this time in what had been a thick woods - the stumps + brush rendering it almost impossible to moove we busied ourselves in cleaning some of it up and by night had it somewhat livable[?] - spent the night without tents - rained during the night and in the morning felt hard - we are close to Fort Bernard and still in sight of Washington       September  20th this (Satturday) morning the regt. made an early start and marched about 5 miles for picket duty in the vicinity of Baileys Crop road - after spending 24 hours in this capacity - returned again to our camp among the stumps - got in about 12 O’clock sunday- in our march out I accidentally sprained my foot and could not keep my place in line coming in on account of it ----
[20-21]  September  26th to day we mooved again to more eligible ground and our whole brigade camped together in a nice field about ½ mile distant - this was called camp Prescott Smith --- on sunday the 28th we had our first brigade review in a field nearby - it passed off satisfactory - I participated but had to fall out of line on account of my foot which was yet painful -------    September   On the 29th a heavy detail was made from our regt.  For fatigue duty on entrenchments Oct 1st division remained at Baileys Crop Roads - very warm day- I was not out on account of my lame foot Oct 2nd 24 hours and picket again at the same place and before - my foot getting better but did not go out and so our time was occupied
[22-23]  October   With the usual routine of camp life until the 20th when the brigade moved in a body at 4 O’clock in the morning for Poolsville MD I happening to be on Brigade company guard at this time did not accompany them but followed on the 13th with the wagon train and joined the regt while it was doing picket duty at Edwards ferry in the Potomac and about    October  6 miles from Poolsville on the 15th - this move[?] from camp Prescott Smith to Poolsville proved to be a very hard one to the men - they being short of food part of the time and the service being much harder than they had ever experienced - and thus we Suffered many privations from exertion and fatigue until the 20th when we returned to Poolsville and
[24-25] *  October  Established our camp in company with our whole Division (Stoneman’s) our time was spent [?] for [?] in during our short stay - on the 22nd we were presented with [?] on the 26th [?] bad day  October  On the 28th the whole Division[?] marched-- crossed the Potomac at Edwards ferry [?]ing it-- This was[?] [?] and wet [?]-- spent an unpleasant night in [?] [?]--dried our clothes as best we could by large[?] fire made of fence Rails appropriated for the purpose at the Expense of [?] --- [?] [?] in [?] been[?] the secesh[?] of the[?]
[26-27]   October  And ^on^ virignias sacred soil again until the 31st when we were mustered for our pay for the first time and then marched to Leesburgh about 7 miles arriving there about 5 O’clock when the 58th was ordered out on picket about 4 mile further - we reached our post early in the evening though after dark pretty well worn out by the work of the day     October  November     Returned to Leesburgh on the next evening (saturday Nov 1st) On sunday morning the 2nd, were ordered into line at 4 O’clock but did not moove until 3 O’clock in the afternoon - heavy cannonading faintly heard all day which proved to be Gen Pleasontons command in contact with the Rebs in advance - Kept up our march far into the night
[28-29]  November  and Stoped at a place called  Mt Gilead -- monday 3rd cold and a little tiered - drew a fresh Supply of grub - marched in a S.W- direction at 11 O’clock leaving a guard about 20 men from the 68th in company and a detail from other Regt of the brigade to follow with some company stores and other Regiment property, which was afterwards taken possession of by the Rebs      November   And the guard taking prisoners - we have not seen them since Now commences a series of rough marches which we have as yet had little experience in our next stop was at a place called Millville which we reached late at night and remained here till the 5th when we again got under way crossing through Middleborough an old town situated on a turnpike and
[30-31]  November  is said to be of secesh proclivities - we passed the Penna Bucktails here - towards evening we stoped on a fine looking plantation long enough to make a cup of coffee much to the detriment of the fences in our reach which we appropriated for our little fires to cook by - we are soon underway again + it is now dark- we pass White Plain     November  And stop for the night near Salem - it is raining and the 68th is ordered out on picket we go but a little way however and stop in a woods which affords us a partial shelter from the threatening storm and thus we spend the night better than if we had been kept with the Brigade
[32-33]   November   6th this was a very severe days march, we made an Early Start and the road was unusually rough chiefly through bye roads of the worst description - we passed what is known as broad gap and late at night stopped in a field at the road side and without much company lay down on the damp ground with our knapsack for a pillow and slept till morning -     November  7th this is a very cold morning and snowing - the first we have experienced - a march of about 2 miles and we are halted in the edge of the woods on the side of the road near the rapidan creek and in the vicinity of Waterloo- the bridge across the creek had been burned and we are compelled to stop - until another is built -
[34-35]  November  9th this morning we go out on picket about one mile distant in the evening we are informed that the Brigade has mooved and we are ordered to follow - which we proceed to do - the bridge having been rebuilt so that we can cross - after a march of about four mile we come up with the Brigade quartered for the night in an     November  open field on what is Said to to be the Culpeper Road - we stay here until the 12th - it is very cold --  on the 12th we make a backward moove and retrace our steps through Waterloo and quarter again in a thick pine woods which affords us admirable shelter; about 5 mile from Warrenton - on the evening of the 15th the 68th
[36-37]  November  is again ordered out on picket about one mile from our home in the woods-  on Sunday Morning the 16th we are informed that the Brigade is again about mooving and we are directed to fall in - which we do and in the afternoon we encamped near Warrenton and spent the night there pleasantly enough ---    November  17th got under way about 10 O’clock - stoped about 2- and made a cup of coffee in a field - marched until late in the evening could find no water - spent an unpleasant night - 18th- marched again. Stoped early in the afternoon - wood and water plenty- was on guard that night - but stood it well-
[38-39]   November   19th got off in pretty good time this morning there is a heavy mist falling which wets us before we seem aware  and has rendered the roads almost impassible -a steady rain threatened we are finally brought to a stand on the side of a hill in a Stubble field and it rains all night -   20th floundered about all day in the yellow mud which now come gushing over shoe top at every step - had Soft quarter that night - in the morning wished I was home -   21st mooved our quarter into a woods near by - our present location fast floating away Spent a pleasanter day and night than the preceding ^one^ Surrounding ded by a thick pine foliage ---
[40-41]   November   22nd took up our line of march again - took dinner in a cornfield and continued our march until late in the Evening Stopping near where we are present located-   23rd - Sunday morning - mooved about ½ mile and encamped  about 1 mile from Falmouth we are perhaps 2 mile Inland from the Rappahanock ---    nover  November   and nearby opposite Fredericksburgh where the Rebs is Strongly Entrenched - and here we remain in Sight of the enemy, with nothing out of the usual routine of camp life to note. Spending our time drills Inspection and review from day to day ---  29th 30th to day we are ordered on picket march about 5 miles and return on the
[42-43]  December  3d of December - nothing worthy of note having occurred during our absence ---  5th this morning we were informed that the U.S. paymaster was in camp to pay us our $25- Bounty promised by the government at the time of our enlistment - we were soon in line to approach him and after standing about 2 hours in a cold rain awaiting our turn we received our U S Greenbacks ---     December  I Sent $20 home by mail which went safely - keeping $5 for myself--  6th snow and rain all day very cold + disagreeable --  7th Sunday -- Storm continues and very cold - winter set in earnestly ---  8th clear and very cold - everything froze up - our little tents affording poor shelter
[44-45]  December  X11th the battle of Fredericksburgh commenced this morning - we were ordered into line at an early hour - lay in a field near by all day in company with the whole Division - could distinctly hear the canonading - and See the Smoke of the conflict which was uninterrupted during the day -- in the evening we advanced about 2 mile and took a  position    December   in a pine woods near Falmouth and remained here until about 4 o’clock  friday afternoon - the fight not appearing to be so General as it was the day before - our next moove was about 2 miles below Fredericksburg and in the vicinity of our Pontoon Bridges - where we arived late at night and remained until Satturday morning the 13th which was the day of the hardest fighting of the Battle--
[46-47]  December  13th got under way about 9 o’clock - marched about 2 miles and stocked arms on the hill near the river - heavy firing on both sides- lay here about an hour again moove on at a rapid pace   Cross the river at one O’clock and in an another hour of quick marching through deep mud we are in the field and face to face with the enemy--     December  on our arival we are at once placed in the front of the battle and have the pleasure of Seeing the Rebs fall back into the edge of a woods beyond the reach of our rifels -- the fight was kept up by artilery on both sides now and we were posted to support one of our batterys in which position we lay until monday morning the 15th--------
[48-49]  December   Sunday 14th ----   occasional picket firing was kept up all night - we kept our position without sleep and now feel rusty -   Co. B goes on the picket line at 4 O’clock this day advances, without much firing on either side - one of Co B’s men is brought in wounded on picket - after dark we are sent to take a turn on picket     December    - not a very comfortable arangement for us after the fatigue of the last 48 hours - we go however as in duty bound, and put in the night the peculiar whistle of the Rebs bullets over our heads is kept up just regular enough to keep us awake -- we are relieved before daylight and return to our Regt. which is still in the front line ---
[50-51]   December  Monday 15th Soon after daylight we were removed from our perilous position and fell back to the rear though still in the field - I wrote to my wife and found an opportunity to make some coffee which I much needed -  about 2 O’clock we were mooved still further back and occupied the road until evening--     December  There was no fighting to day of any account and after dark in the evening preperations begin for a retreat as it turned out to be, though we little thought of such a thing at the time - we mooved about 8 O’clock every precaution being taken to moove as quietly as possible, we soon found we were approaching the River at the same
[52-53]  December   point we crossed the day before which confirmed the Suspicions which we had formed from the Stealthiness of the moove that we were on a retreat - we crossed the River again and continued on a roundabout march through mud ankles deep into the Small hours of the night and finally stoped in a friendly woods much worn out -     December  16th - we are awakened this morning by a heavy rain which has give us a good [?] off and wet everything around us - we do not remain here long but get our things together and join the crowd of retreating soldiers and after another rough uneven march of about 2 hours we arive at our old camping ground again and pitch our little tents -
[54-55]  December  17th our time is now occupied for a few days in fixing up quarters for ourselves and making ourselves as comfortable as circumstances will admit, on the 24th we go out on picket again to the same place we were about the 1st -- and thus we spend our first Christmas in the army of the Potomac we return to camp     December  on the 27th and find every thing about as we left --   on the 31st we are mustered for our pay up to the first of the year - and So the old familliar 52 is at an end -- let us hope that long before we are done with 53 we may be restored to our homes enjoying the blessings of peace once more - which we will now know how to -- appreciate -       [Here, Pickel clearly is referring to the close of 1862 and the beginning of 1863. It is not clear why he writes “52” and “53”, rather than “62” and “63”]
[56-57]  January-1853   [1863. It is unclear why Pickel writes “1853” here]   1st New Years day was spent in camp much as every other is spent only that we had no drills - we lingered round camp at will and thought of better days --   16th there is a rumor in camp that we are on the eve of another moove but the day wears away without any official announcement on that score our quarters are now becoming familiar     January 1853  to us and we regret to part with them as we would with an old valued friend--   17th I am agreeably Supprised this morning at the appearance in camp of my friend mr.

[66-67]  January 23rd  there is no appearance of Clear weather yet and the Condition of the roads renders it impossible to make any moove yet -- the wagons are stuck fast in the mud -- our provision train cannot reach us -- it lays two mile back and we are fast approaching the bottoms of our haversacks ---  at 12 O’clock we get the order to prepare     January --  to march back to our old camp in about an hour we are under way and reach our camp again about Sundown by taking a shot cut through fields and bye ways   -- 24th we have clear weather to day and busy ourselfes in fixing up our tents and drying our blankets + [?]_________
