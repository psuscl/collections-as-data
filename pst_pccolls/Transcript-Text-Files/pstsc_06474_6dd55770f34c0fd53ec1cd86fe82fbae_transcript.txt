1.   March 8, 1861.                  We were in recitation from 9 till 12 O'clock today. The debaters for the 15th met to select a question. We selected the following: “Should public opinion be regarded as the standard of right.” Received a very interesting letter from J.A Young -- In Society-- I read from HIstory Napoleon's entry into Moscow. Attended to my duties as Critic, made several motions, of but little importance, which were passed. The performances this evening were not as good as they should have been - as we had several visitors -------
2.  March 9.          The Reading Room required some little fixing up this morning to which I attended. Brought “Thier’s Napoleon” from the Library [Adolphe Thiers was a French politician perhaps best known for his political opposition to Napoleon III, his multivolume history of the French Revolution and, later, for serving as head of state and then President of France from 1871 to 1873]. After Prayers nearly all of our Class were invited to Smith’s room, where we had some most excellent cake. About half an hour later we had another treat in Miles’ room, which, though of a different kind, was equally delicious -- The R.R. officers met, and made further selections of periodicals. I received from home a roll of carpet, which Craig and I put down tonight --      3.  March 10.  Bible Class met at 10 O'clock, Preaching was at 11 ½ by Rev.   He preached a very good sermon -- Owing to the disagreeable state of the weather I did not go out of the Building today more than was necessary.  March 11.                          Tom Roberts and I have concluded to finish a paper for the Anonymous Box. We have entitled “The Champion.” Received a receipt from Haven for the money sent him. Our Class has but one recitation in the afternoon at present.
4.  March 12.                          I commenced an article today for the Champion on “The Insignificant number One and the Great Unterrified.” Did not get much done at it, none of the papers for our Reading Room have been received. The “Independents” are in operation -- This afternoon Gleim and I played at Chess. Neither of us can boast of being superior -- The last of our Class declaimed yesterday evening, and the Second commenced this Evening.   March 13.  We recited today from 9 till 12 and from 3      5.  till 5 to Dr. Pugh, and from 1 till 2 to Prof Whitman -- J.D. Isett returned from Spruce Creek with some HCL. -- This evening I have been engaged in constructing some figures for our recitation in mathematics tomorrow. Craig W. spoke in usual splendid style -- Fisher did very well.  March 14.  This morning the ground was covered with snow, and as far as I have observed, snow has been falling all day without much headway -- Our Class did not get out of recitation till about six O'clock this evening. We were in altogether, nearly seven hours -- Several Reading Room
6.  papers came with the mail -- The R.R. has not been opened.  March 15.  The recitation in Analytical Geometry, and lecture on Crystallography were omitted this morning --          An excess of HCL produced some fun this afternoon. Prof Wilson hearing the noise, came up, and caught me in making some classic gyrations. After five O'clock a number of us went down to the store, and made quite a diminution of the stock of candies -- Society was pretty well attended -- There were several visitors present -- I      7.  read Haven’s receipt, which was received by the Society, and the Catalogue Committee discharged. Question for debate “Should public opinion be considered as the standard of right.” Isett J.D. and Bullock were on the affirmative, myself and Shinn[?] on the negative. Decided in favor of the negative -- We then had an extemporaneous debate. On the Aff. were Bullock and Tom Roberts -- Negative Fisher and myself. The question was selected by the President. “Will the English Language become universally prevalent.” Gained by aff --
8.   March 16.                          As Dr. Pugh was not here today we had no recitations. -- Borrowed a book entitled “Self-Help” by Smiles, from Willis, and have already perused eighty pages, Perhaps I am too well pleased with it to be much benefited by the first reading, and go over more than I shall be likely to remember. -- Out of the Library I took Hallam’s Literature, and Modern British Essays (Alison). After the arrival of the mail I put the papers in the Reading Room, and kept it open till Supper time --      9.  March 17.                          Bible Class was at 9 O'clock -- Preaching at 3, Continued reading “Self-Help.”  March 18.                          Dr. Pugh started this morning for Harrisburg -- the Appropriation Bill comes up this week -- Wrote to Decatur, Tom Roberts and I have got to work in Earnest at the “Champion.” He has taken “Gay Eagle” as his nom de plume, mine is “Baron Von Bullger.” Today I wrote two pages, “Self-Help” is finished. -- The class met at 3 O'clock, and a lesson was assigned in Logic by Prof Wilson -- Tonight we
10.  had a hearty supper of Eggs and Crackers in J.D. Isett’s room. I went down to Westmore’s and played Chess with him -- Read a little at the beginning of Hallam’s Literature --  March 19. After breakfast I went into Tom’s room and wrote three pages for the “Champion.” Title: “Traits of Character, Sketched by Bullger.” being notices of Don Parker, Beer Brenneman, Tom Roberts, and Bill Bullock. Our paper being ready I handed it to Fisher. -- Our first lesson in Logic was recited at 3 O'clock. I have written out a brief synopsis of it this      11.  evening -- The Reading Room papers now come regularly -- The Room was open from 5 till supper time. Two new students arrived with the stage.  March 20.                          Commenced this forenoon making a copy of Cr. Pugh’s lectures on Crystallography -- Did not attend recitation at one O'clock. The Reading Room must hereafter be opened regularly at 12 and 5 O'clock -- Logic is the most interesting study now pursued at this Institution -- I can’t see that some application made may be made of it in the future -- not so with Crystallography.
12.  March 21.  This morning I wrote two additional pages for the Champion. “Cressonism” was my subject. -- Our paper is now completed - and I think it a very respectable one. -- My duties in the Reading Room prove very pleasant. -- I An excellent opportunity it affords me for becoming acquainted with all the news, and by the time I finish reading, it the hour for closing the room has arrived.          Tonight I have been studying my Logic -- I feel like giving it more attention than other of our Studies.  13.  March 22.  My room being very cold today, I did not stay in it -- We did not recite Logic -- This afternoon I assisted Tom Roberts and C.E. Troutman in preparing a paper (“The Blood and Thunder Miscellany”) for the Anonymous Box -- Society tonight was very interesting. The debate was on a historical question. It was lengthy, but well conducted. The “Champion” and our other paper were read, and of course well received. The former is highly spoken of but some think it somewhat too severe. --          There was a paper called the “Bullock-Lytle,” which was
14.  written as if it were by Bullock + myself -- It was rather a spicy affair. -- By a little exertion through the Anon. Box, I hope to raise an excitement in our Society -- I was appointed on extemporaneous performance, the subject being “Language.” According to my own opinion I did creditably. Miscellaneous business elicited considerable debate. Our session was protracted until later than usual. -- I was appointed on debate for next evening. The question is “Is it probable that our present prob national difficulties will be settled by means of a Compromise.”       15.  March 23.  Today we have had no recitations at all -- I staid in the Reading Room two hours after the arrival of the mail, Tom Roberts and I have concluded that it would be better for each of us to write a paper. He will commence his this week -- I am to continue The Champion -- By writing in opposition to each other we hope to keep up an interest in the Society -- I have prepared a page today -- “Old Oxygen” has been getting his room scrubbed out -- He put his bed clothes in the Hall and has had great trouble to prevent them from being carried off --

I have not been in my room much for several days on account of the cold weather. I have been in room 77 with J.D. Isett. His room-mate J.V. Martin is at home. Tonight we fifth story boys had some fun --  March 26.  Tom Roberts has commenced a new paper called “The Mercury.” From      17.  the manner in which he writes any who one, unacquainted with the circumstances, would suppose that he and The Editor of The “Champion” were great enemies. I received a letter from Decatur this evening -- He gives me all the news from Spruce Creek. After Prayers I accepted of an invitation from Hart to partake of some Cake et.. which he received from home.  March 27. Finished all my articles this morning for The Champion. C.E. Troutman has become assistant editor -- I fell asleep just before three O'clock and therefore I did not attend recitation in Logic. ------
18.  March 28.  I made a few notes today on our question for debate, for Friday -- Tom Roberts wrote No. 2 of the “Blood and Thunder Miscellany.” Received quite a supply of Reading Room papers, I understood that some of the Washingtonians are getting up a new paper in opposition to the “Champion.” They will have to fight against “old veterans” and may not leave the field without some of the marks of War   March 29.  Tom and I wrote two more papers this morning. “The Journal of       19.  Civilization” and “The Rifleman.” I also prepared a piece of poetry (rhyme) for The “Champion.” There were a great many papers tonight in the Anonymous Box. All well written -- I proposed John J. Crittenden as a honorary member of our Society - he was elected -- I was on debate, but did not gain the decision.  March 30.

There was considerable debating on both sides -- Roberts and Parker for it -- Bullock and myself against -- The Committee
32.  rose.

Lynn Troutman and I took a walk to woods this evening. Tom Roberts is very much chagrined over the defeat of his resolution last night, and predicts that mine will be again considered, and will be “defeated” before another election is held -- Secessionism has assumed some importance, the news daily received are of rather a serious character, and of course create some interest among the students of the F.H.S.

ED. PHILADA. INQUIRER: -- The most intense Union feeling exhibits itself among the students of this Institution. The spirit of patriotism and loyalty is fully aroused. Over the building proudly waves the “Stars and Stripes,” and within its walls are those who will gladly march to the defence of that flag, when they shall be needed.          A Company has been organized by the students, with a view to taking exercise in drilling. They do not anticipate exchanging, at present, their studies for the field of battle, but are determined to be prepared when their country shall call. This movement receives great encouragement from the Faculty, one of its members having accepted the post of Captain.
[Diary]  At first I supposed it merely a whim of some of the students, but being encouraged by the Faculty, will no doubt be conducted according to true military style -- --------------------  Received a letter from J.A.

Did not attend Chemistry recitation - but was at recitations in Geology and Analytical Geometry. Was in the Reading Room from after 5 O'clock till dark -- We have gre not great facilities for obtaining the news here. The mail arrives from Spruce Creek tri-weekly, and as events of vast importance are daily occurring in our Country - there is of course a great desire to procure the papers. But we have the consolation that their delay causes them to be received with increased delight -- The day has been wet and cloudy - but as the wind is now up we may expect clearer weather soon. --
50.  May 7.

52.  May 8.  This evening I commenced writing a new Anonymous paper entitled the “Old Ironsides Miscellany” -- What I have written is concerning the inf interferences of Dr. Pugh in the affairs of our Society -- During the time that I was at home he made threats that our Society would be dissolved unless the Anonymous papers were prevented from mentioning the Faculty, their person, dress, or actions -- The worthy gentleman tried this game last session but did not succeed -- He then made similar threats but never put      53.  them into execution -- And I believe that the Society is determined to be free - that no outside “authority” will be tolerated -- The day has been pleasanter than yesterday - but the weather is not yet as it should be in May --  May 9. Was not at 9 11 O'clock recitation today. Our class sent for hats some time ago, and they were received today. They are of a dark gray color -- The rim turns up so as almost to meet the crown, and is bound with red, white, and blue -- Parker and Watts C. who ran away from the School on Sunday night, re-
54.  turned in the stage -- This evening after prayers I walked out towards the Barrens with Troutman C. & Tom Roberts. We stopped at a farm house and bought a pie -- I did not yet read the latest news -- This has been a very pleasant day -- Sun shining, but without too great a warmth --   This afternoon Wm. M. McAllister, of Virginia, started for home. His father is an officer in the Secession Army -- While here he has avowed a strong Union feeling - but perhaps he did this only from necessity. I hope that if he has been sincere that he may not depart from this wise choice.      55.  May 10.  We had but one recitation to day, which was C Analy. Geometry at 4 O'clock -- This evening I wrote another number (the 7th) of the Champion Did not put in the paper which I wrote on Wednesday -- I attended to arranging the Hall for the meeting of our Society -- I was on Debate -- Troutman & Smith [sic] were on the Affirmative -- Tyson and myself on Neg. -- Question “Should military acquirements be influence the election of the President of the U.S.” -- Tyson did not debate, but the question was decided unanimously in
56.  favor of the Negative -- The resolution prepared by Tom Roberts and myself was red read tonight. I moved that a Committee be appointed to invite the members of the Faculty to be present at the next meeting, in order that they may hear the discussion an[d] decission on the resolution and also that the Committee inform Dr. Pugh that this will be the final action of the Society on in reference to Anonymous papers.           I visited the Cresson after our Society had adjourned --  May 11  Dr. Pugh went to Bellefonte today -- We had no recitations --      57.  I brought the “Federalist” from the Library -- Fisher, who edits the “Wasp,” has requested me to exchange papers with him. The object is to prevent it being known who the real authors of these papers are -- I have consented.

60.  prayers the Committee from W.A.L.S. called upon the Faculty. I stated that we had been authorized to invite the members of the Faculty to attend the meeting of our Society on Friday evening next - that the subject of the Anonymous papers would then be considered and that the action then taken would be final -- While the Society had no disposition to disrep disrespect the authority of the Faculty - and while it would endeavor th to settle the dispute satisfactorily - it would not place its own dignity at stake, nor do anything that would be inconsistent with its own honor -- Our Constitution for a while, with       61.  regard to this question, was very loose, but wholesome restrictions had been made, and it was quite probable that more would have been added, but all interferences of outside authority had an irritating effect, and this was destructive of the end at which it aimed ---- After this we had a conversation relative to the matter - and throughout we en endeavored to impress the Faculty with the fact that we wished to govern ourselves - and that we had faith in our ability to do it wisely --  May 15 - This forenoon the class went to get the manure ready for our oats plots -- Dr. Pugh this year intends experimenting

May 16 - I was out this forenoon sowing manure. We had no recitations today -- Wrote some for the “Wasp” -- I declaimed in Chapel this evening, and was severely criticized by Prof Wilson. I know that I am unable to make a good delamation [sic] - and moreover, I feel then altogether useless, except it be to remove diffidence --           The brickmakers have commenced work, and other workmen will commence work on the building soon -- Today there has been considerable wind ----

The Wasp was very well received, but the Champion appeared to suffer in Fisher’s hands + the Faculty except Prof Whitman was present. The resolution which in which they were interested was discussed by Roberts, Bullock, Kisterbock, and myself, all in favor of       65.  it. It was passed unanimously.

I therefore resigned my position as speaker -- The resignation was not received -- After some time better order prevailed -- all committees appointed at last meeting were dismissed and two new ones appointed - one on general arrangements - the other on invitations.
