# Digital Map Drawer GeoJSON Export

This repository contains a JSON document of all of the publicly available items in the Digital Map Drawer from Penn State University as of August 31, 2023.

Following a metadata enhancement and improvement project, we exported the metadata from ContentDM and pulled out just enough features to generate coordinate points which would allow it to be plotted on a map and enough descriptive metadata to allow users to know what they are looking at.

The properties come from the metadata fields Title, Creator, Date Created, Publisher, and Publication Place.

The files can be used in your own applications by taking the file and uploading it anywhere that accepts GeoJSON files, including GoogleMaps, ArcGIS, and QGIS.
