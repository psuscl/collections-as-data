\f0\fs22 \cf2 This repository contains a JSON document of all of the publicly available items in the Digital Map Drawer from Penn State University as of August 31, 2023.\
\
Following a metadata enhancement and improvement project, we exported the metadata from ContentDM and pulled out just enough features to generate coordinate points which would allow it to be plotted on a map and enough descriptive metadata to allow users to know what they are looking at.\
\
The properties come from the metadata fields Title, Creator, Date Created, Publisher, and Publication Place. \
\
The files can be used in your own applications by taking the file and uploading it anywhere that accepts JSON files, including GoogleMaps, ArcGIS, and QGIS.}
